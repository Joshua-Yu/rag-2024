  Extraction","This paper addresses a crucial challenge in retrieval-augmented
generation-based relation extractors; the end-to-end training is not applicable
to conventional retrieval-augmented generation due to the non-differentiable
nature of instance retrieval. This problem prevents the instance retrievers
from being optimized for the relation extraction task, and conventionally it
must be trained with an objective different from that for relation extraction.
To address this issue, we propose a novel End-to-end Trainable
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ETRAG), which allows end-to-end optimization of
the entire model, including the retriever, for the relation extraction
objective by utilizing a differentiable selection of the $k$ nearest instances.
We evaluate the relation extraction performance of ETRAG on the TACRED dataset,
which is a standard benchmark for relation extraction. ETRAG demonstrates
consistent improvements against the baseline model as retrieved instances are
added. Furthermore, the analysis of instances retrieved by the end-to-end
trained retriever confirms that the retrieved instances contain common relation
labels or entities with the query and are specialized for the target task. Our
findings provide a promising foundation for future research on
retrieval-augmented generation and the broader applications of text generation
in Natural Language Processing.",Kohei Makino

this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to
refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting
to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding
multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation

the hallucination of large language models (LLMs). However, existing research
lacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation on
different large language models, which make it challenging to identify the
potential bottlenecks in the capabilities of RAG for different LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented
Generation on large language models. We analyze the performance of different
large language models in 4 fundamental abilities required for RAG, including
noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and
counterfactual robustness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented
Generation Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in both English and
Chinese. RGB divides the instances within the benchmark into 4 separate
testbeds based on the aforementioned fundamental abilities required to resolve
the case. Then we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diagnose the
challenges of current LLMs when applying RAG. Evaluation reveals that while
LLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robustness, they still struggle
significantly in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and
dealing with false information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes indicate
that there is still a considerable journey ahead to effectively apply RAG to

achievements in various domains. However, the untimeliness and cost of
knowledge updates coupled with hallucination issues of LLMs have curtailed
their applications in knowledge intensive tasks, where retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) can be of help. Nevertheless, existing retrieval augmented
models typically use similarity as a bridge between queries and documents and

degrade the performance of retrieval augmented generation. To this end, we
propose MetRag, a Multi layEred Thoughts enhanced Retrieval Augmented

LLM for utility oriented thought and further come up with a smarter model by
comprehensively combining the similarity and utility oriented thoughts.
Furthermore, given the fact that the retrieved document set tends to be huge
and using them in isolation makes it difficult to capture the commonalities and
characteristics among them, we propose to make an LLM as a task adaptive

such as document-based question answering (DBQA). However, the effectiveness of
RAG is highly dependent on its configuration. To systematically find the
optimal configuration, we introduce RAGGED, a framework for analyzing RAG
configurations across various DBQA tasks. Using the framework, we discover
distinct LM behaviors in response to varying context quantities, context
qualities, and retrievers. For instance, while some models are robust to noisy
contexts, monotonically performing better with more contexts, others are more
noise-sensitive and can effectively use only a few contexts before declining in
performance. This framework also provides a deeper analysis of these
differences by evaluating the LMs' sensitivity to signal and noise under
specific context quality conditions. Using RAGGED, researchers and
practitioners can derive actionable insights about how to optimally configure
their RAG systems for their specific question-answering tasks.",Jennifer Hsia

  Questions","Generative search engines have the potential to transform how people seek

Nonetheless, retrieval-augmented generation exacerbates safety concerns, since
adversaries may successfully evade the entire system by subtly manipulating the
most vulnerable part of a claim. To this end, we propose evaluating the
robustness of generative search engines in the realistic and high-risk setting,
where adversaries have only black-box system access and seek to deceive the
model into returning incorrect responses. Through a comprehensive human
evaluation of various generative search engines, such as Bing Chat,
PerplexityAI, and YouChat across diverse queries, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of adversarial factual questions in inducing incorrect responses.
Moreover, retrieval-augmented generation exhibits a higher susceptibility to
factual errors compared to LLMs without retrieval. These findings highlight the
potential security risks of these systems and emphasize the need for rigorous
evaluation before deployment.",Xuming Hu

for a weak assessment of model similarity. Thus, in this study, we evaluate the
similarity of embedding models within the context of RAG systems. Our
assessment is two-fold: We use Centered Kernel Alignment to compare embeddings
on a pair-wise level. Additionally, as it is especially pertinent to RAG

using Jaccard and rank similarity. We compare different families of embedding
models, including proprietary ones, across five datasets from the popular

clusters of models corresponding to model families, but interestingly, also
some inter-family clusters. Furthermore, our analysis of top-k retrieval

  Augmented Generation","The existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges in terms of cost and effectiveness. On one hand, they need to encode
the lengthy retrieved contexts before responding to the input tasks, which
imposes substantial computational overhead. On the other hand, directly using
generic Large Language Models (LLMs) often leads to sub-optimal answers, while
task-specific fine-tuning may compromise the LLMs' general capabilities. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called FlexRAG
(Flexible Context Adaptation for RAG). In this approach, the retrieved contexts
are compressed into compact embeddings before being encoded by the LLMs.
Simultaneously, these compressed embeddings are optimized to enhance downstream
RAG performance. A key feature of FlexRAG is its flexibility, which enables
effective support for diverse compression ratios and selective preservation of
important contexts. Thanks to these technical designs, FlexRAG achieves
superior generation quality while significantly reducing running costs.
Comprehensive experiments on various question-answering datasets validate our
approach as a cost-effective and flexible solution for RAG systems.",Zheng Liu

  Language Models to Specialized Domains","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the question-answering (QA)
abilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge.
However, adapting general-purpose RAG systems to specialized fields such as
science and medicine poses unique challenges due to distribution shifts and
limited access to domain-specific data. To tackle this, we propose SimRAG, a
self-training approach that equips the LLM with joint capabilities of question
answering and question generation for domain adaptation. Our method first
fine-tunes the LLM on instruction-following, question-answering, and
search-related data. Then, it prompts the same LLM to generate diverse
domain-relevant questions from unlabeled corpora, with an additional filtering
strategy to retain high-quality synthetic examples. By leveraging these
synthetic examples, the LLM can improve their performance on domain-specific
RAG tasks. Experiments on 11 datasets, spanning two backbone sizes and three
domains, demonstrate that SimRAG outperforms baselines by 1.2\%--8.6\%.",Ran Xu

  K-12 Educational Question Answering with Knowledge Discrepancies","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have demonstrated remarkable
potential as question answering systems in the K-12 Education domain, where
knowledge is typically queried within the restricted scope of authoritative
textbooks. However, the discrepancy between textbooks and the parametric
knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) could undermine the effectiveness of
RAG systems. To systematically investigate the robustness of RAG systems under
such knowledge discrepancies, we present EduKDQA, a question answering dataset
that simulates knowledge discrepancies in real applications by applying
hypothetical knowledge updates in answers and source documents. EduKDQA
includes 3,005 questions covering five subjects, under a comprehensive question
typology from the perspective of context utilization and knowledge integration.
We conducted extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering
performance. We find that most RAG systems suffer from a substantial
performance drop in question answering with knowledge discrepancies, while
questions that require integration of contextual knowledge and parametric

attend to all contexts. Previous work has addressed this by synthesizing
contexts with perturbed positions of gold segment, creating a
position-diversified train set. We extend this intuition to propose consistency
regularization with augmentation and distillation. First, we augment each
training instance with its position perturbation to encourage consistent
predictions, regardless of ordering. We also distill behaviors of this pair,
although it can be counterproductive in certain RAG scenarios where the given
order from the retriever is crucial for generation quality. We thus propose
CORD, balancing COnsistency and Rank Distillation. CORD adaptively samples
noise-controlled perturbations from an interpolation space, ensuring both

DePaC (Dehallucinating Parallel Context Extension), which alleviates the

observed that the performance diminishes when dealing with less-popular or
low-frequency concepts and entities, for example in domain specific
applications. The two prominent approaches to enhance the performance of LMs on
low-frequent topics are: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning
(FT) over synthetic data. This paper explores and evaluates the impact of RAG
and FT on customizing LMs in handling low-frequency entities on question
answering tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on twelve LMs of varying size
and type and different fine tuning, data augmentation, and retrieval models.
Our findings indicate that while FT boosts the performance across entities of
varying popularity, RAG surpasses FT by a large margin particularly for least
popular factual knowledge. Additionally, the success of both RAG and FT
approaches is amplified by improving retrieval and data augmentation
techniques. Fine tuning, while beneficial for small LMs, requires extensive
resources. To address this issue, we propose the new Stimulus RAG approach that
surpasses the effectiveness of fine tuning based approaches, thereby
eliminating the need for the costly data augmentation and fine tuning step for
enriching LMs with less popular factual knowledge. The code is available at

the performance of RAG and FN for the GPT-J-6B, OPT-6.7B, LlaMA, LlaMA-2

demonstrate that RAG-based constructions are more efficient than models
produced with FN. We point out that connecting RAG and FN is not trivial,
because connecting FN models with RAG can cause a decrease in performance.
Furthermore, we outline a simple RAG-based architecture which, on average,
outperforms the FN models by 16% in terms of the ROGUE score, 15% in the case
of the BLEU score, and 53% based on the cosine similarity. This shows the
significant advantage of RAG over FN in terms of hallucination, which is not
offset by the fact that the average 8% better METEOR score of FN models
indicates greater creativity compared to RAG.",Robert Lakatos

technique to adapt models to private users data without training, to handle
credit attribution, and to allow efficient machine unlearning at scale.
However, RAG techniques for image generation may lead to parts of the retrieved
samples being copied in the model's output. To reduce risks of leaking private
information contained in the retrieved set, we introduce Copy-Protected
generation with Retrieval (CPR), a new method for RAG with strong copyright
protection guarantees in a mixed-private setting for diffusion models.CPR
allows to condition the output of diffusion models on a set of retrieved
images, while also guaranteeing that unique identifiable information about
those example is not exposed in the generated outputs. In particular, it does
so by sampling from a mixture of public (safe) distribution and private (user)
distribution by merging their diffusion scores at inference. We prove that CPR
satisfies Near Access Freeness (NAF) which bounds the amount of information an
attacker may be able to extract from the generated images. We provide two
algorithms for copyright protection, CPR-KL and CPR-Choose. Unlike previously
proposed rejection-sampling-based NAF methods, our methods enable efficient
copyright-protected sampling with a single run of backward diffusion. We show
that our method can be applied to any pre-trained conditional diffusion model,
such as Stable Diffusion or unCLIP. In particular, we empirically show that
applying CPR on top of unCLIP improves quality and text-to-image alignment of
the generated results (81.4 to 83.17 on TIFA benchmark), while enabling credit

optimization opportunities (i.e., caching knowledge's intermediate states).
Based on these insights, we design RAGCache, which organizes the intermediate
states of retrieved knowledge in a knowledge tree and caches them in the GPU
and host memory hierarchy. RAGCache proposes a replacement policy that is aware
of LLM inference characteristics and RAG retrieval patterns. It also
dynamically overlaps the retrieval and inference steps to minimize the
end-to-end latency. We implement RAGCache and evaluate it on vLLM, a
state-of-the-art LLM inference system and Faiss, a state-of-the-art vector

existing methods are data-driven, need additional utility evaluators or

them into plug-and-play classification tasks, which achieves multifaceted
retrieval timing judgements with negligible extra inference cost. We further
introduce the Unified Active Retrieval Criteria (UAR-Criteria), designed to
process diverse active retrieval scenarios through a standardized procedure.

focus on question scenarios with clear user intents and concise answers.
However, it is prevalent that users issue broad, open-ended queries with

multiple relevant aspects. To tackle this important yet underexplored problem,
we propose a novel RAG framework, namely RichRAG. It includes a sub-aspect
explorer to identify potential sub-aspects of input questions, a multi-faceted
retriever to build a candidate pool of diverse external documents related to
these sub-aspects, and a generative list-wise ranker, which is a key module to
provide the top-k most valuable documents for the final generator. These ranked
documents sufficiently cover various query aspects and are aware of the
generator's preferences, hence incentivizing it to produce rich and
comprehensive responses for users. The training of our ranker involves a
supervised fine-tuning stage to ensure the basic coverage of documents, and a
reinforcement learning stage to align downstream LLM's preferences to the

directly predicting final answers despite potentially noisy inputs, resulting
in an implicit denoising process that is difficult to interpret and verify. On
the other hand, the acquisition of explicit denoising supervision is often

InstructRAG, where LMs explicitly learn the denoising process through
self-synthesized rationales -- First, we instruct the LM to explain how the
ground-truth answer is derived from retrieved documents. Then, these rationales
can be used either as demonstrations for in-context learning of explicit
denoising or as supervised fine-tuning data to train the model. Compared to
standard RAG approaches, InstructRAG requires no additional supervision, allows
for easier verification of the predicted answers, and effectively improves

existing RAG methods in both training-free and trainable scenarios, achieving a

jailbreak attack, which designed to evade model safety mechanisms and induce
the generation of inappropriate content. Existing jailbreak attacks primarily
rely on crafting inducement prompts for direct jailbreaks, which are less

provides a new avenue for jailbreak attacks.
  In this paper, we conduct the first work to propose the concept of indirect
jailbreak and achieve Retrieval-Augmented Generation via LangChain. Building on
this, we further design a novel method of indirect jailbreak attack, termed
Poisoned-LangChain (PLC), which leverages a poisoned external knowledge base to

modalities. However, a significant drawback of MLLMs is their reliance on
static training data, leading to outdated information and limited contextual

Though integrating Multimodal Retrieval-augmented Generation (Multimodal RAG)
offers a promising solution, the system would inevitably encounter the
multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC) problem, which hinders accurate
retrieval and generation. In this work, we propose RagVL, a novel framework
with knowledge-enhanced reranking and noise-injected training, to address these
limitations. We instruction-tune the MLLM with a simple yet effective
instruction template to induce its ranking ability and serve it as a reranker
to precisely filter the top-k retrieved images. For generation, we inject
visual noise during training at the data and token levels to enhance the
generator's robustness. Extensive experiments on the subsets of two datasets

Large Language Model or LLM applications. RAG involves taking a user query and
finding relevant paragraphs of context in a large corpus typically captured in
a vector database. Once the first level of search happens over a vector
database, the top n chunks of relevant text are included directly in the
context and sent as prompt to the LLM. Problem with this approach is that
quality of text chunks depends on effectiveness of search. There is no strong
post processing after search to determine if the chunk does hold enough
information to include in prompt. Also many times there may be chunks that have
conflicting information on the same subject and the model has no prior
experience which chunk to prioritize to make a decision. Often times, this
leads to the model providing a statement that there are conflicting statements,
and it cannot produce an answer. In this research we propose a Bayesian
approach to verify the quality of text chunks from the search results. Bayes
theorem tries to relate conditional probabilities of the hypothesis with
evidence and prior probabilities. We propose that, finding likelihood of text
chunks to give a quality answer and using prior probability of quality of text
chunks can help us improve overall quality of the responses from RAG systems.
We can use the LLM itself to get a likelihood of relevance of a context
paragraph. For prior probability of the text chunk, we use the page number in
the documents parsed. Assumption is that that paragraphs in earlier pages have
a better probability of being findings and more relevant to generalizing an

a suitable dataset containing multiple knowledge sources and pre-exploration of
the associated issues. To address these challenges, we standardize a benchmark

complementary domains. Based on this dataset, we further develop a
plug-and-play RAG framework, PruningRAG, whose main characteristic is to employ
multi-granularity pruning strategies for optimizing the integration of relevant

the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains

relevant documents from a corpus and integrates them into the LLMs' generation
process. In this study, we investigate the adversarial robustness of RAG,
focusing specifically on examining the retrieval system. First, across 225
different setup combinations of corpus, retriever, query, and targeted
information, we show that retrieval systems are vulnerable to universal
poisoning attacks in medical Q\&A. In such attacks, adversaries generate
poisoned documents containing a broad spectrum of targeted information, such as
personally identifiable information. When these poisoned documents are inserted
into a corpus, they can be accurately retrieved by any users, as long as
attacker-specified queries are used. To understand this vulnerability, we
discovered that the deviation from the query's embedding to that of the
poisoned document tends to follow a pattern in which the high similarity
between the poisoned document and the query is retained, thereby enabling
precise retrieval. Based on these findings, we develop a new detection-based
defense to ensure the safe use of RAG. Through extensive experiments spanning
various Q\&A domains, we observed that our proposed method consistently

context awareness of LLMs degrades their performance on RAG tasks. Existing
methods to enhance context awareness are often inefficient, incurring time or
memory overhead during inference, and many are tailored to specific position
embeddings. In this paper, we propose Position-Embedding-Agnostic attention
Re-weighting (PEAR), which enhances the context awareness of LLMs with zero
inference overhead. Specifically, on a proxy task focused on context copying,
we first detect heads which suppress the models' context awareness thereby
diminishing RAG performance. To weaken the impact of these heads, we re-weight
their outputs with learnable coefficients. The LLM (with frozen parameters) is
optimized by adjusting these coefficients to minimize loss on the proxy task.
As a result, the coefficients are optimized to values less than one, thereby
reducing their tendency to suppress RAG performance. During inference, the
optimized coefficients are fixed to re-weight these heads, regardless of the
specific task at hand. Our proposed PEAR offers two major advantages over
previous approaches: (1) It introduces zero additional inference overhead in

  Verification in Retrieval Augmented Generation","While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has been shown to enhance
factuality of large language model (LLM) outputs, LLMs still suffer from
hallucination, generating incorrect or irrelevant information. One common
detection strategy involves prompting the LLM again to assess whether its
response is grounded in the retrieved evidence, but this approach is costly.
Alternatively, lightweight natural language inference (NLI) models for
efficient grounding verification can be used at inference time. While existing
pre-trained NLI models offer potential solutions, their performance remains
subpar compared to larger models on realistic RAG inputs. RAG inputs are more
complex than most datasets used for training NLI models and have
characteristics specific to the underlying knowledge base, requiring adaptation
of the NLI models to a specific target domain. Additionally, the lack of
labeled instances in the target domain makes supervised domain adaptation,
e.g., through fine-tuning, infeasible. To address these challenges, we
introduce Automatic Generative Domain Adaptation (Auto-GDA). Our framework
enables unsupervised domain adaptation through synthetic data generation.
Unlike previous methods that rely on handcrafted filtering and augmentation
strategies, Auto-GDA employs an iterative process to continuously improve the
quality of generated samples using weak labels from less efficient teacher
models and discrete optimization to select the most promising augmented

long-context large language models (LLMs) across diverse settings. For

incorporate more external knowledge. However, without effectively utilizing
such knowledge, solely expanding context does not always enhance performance.
In this work, we investigate inference scaling for retrieval augmented
generation (RAG), exploring strategies beyond simply increasing the quantity of
knowledge. We focus on two inference scaling strategies: in-context learning
and iterative prompting. These strategies provide additional flexibility to
scale test-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or
generation steps), thereby enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and
utilize contextual information. We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG
performance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally
configured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a
given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference
parameters? Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads
to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a
relationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on
this, we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate RAG
performance across different inference configurations. The model predicts
optimal inference parameters under various computation constraints, which align
closely with the experimental results. By applying these optimal
configurations, we demonstrate that scaling inference compute on long-context

  Secret or Forget Knowledge?","The deployment of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini has
shown their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these
models can inadvertently learn and retain sensitive information and harmful
content during training, raising significant ethical and legal concerns. To
address these issues, machine unlearning has been introduced as a potential
solution. While existing unlearning methods take into account the specific
characteristics of LLMs, they often suffer from high computational demands,
limited applicability, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these
limitations, we propose a lightweight unlearning framework based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. By modifying the external
knowledge base of RAG, we simulate the effects of forgetting without directly
interacting with the unlearned LLM. We approach the construction of unlearned
knowledge as a constrained optimization problem, deriving two key components
that underpin the effectiveness of RAG-based unlearning. This RAG-based
approach is particularly effective for closed-source LLMs, where existing
unlearning methods often fail. We evaluate our framework through extensive

Traditional large language models (LLMs), while powerful, often fall short in

mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge. Recently, there has been a trend of
storing up-to-date or copyrighted data in RAG knowledge databases instead of
using it for LLM training. This practice has raised concerns about Membership
Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to detect if a specific target document is
stored in the RAG system's knowledge database so as to protect the rights of
data producers. While research has focused on enhancing the trustworthiness of
RAG systems, existing MIAs for RAG systems remain largely insufficient.
Previous work either relies solely on the RAG system's judgment or is easily
influenced by other documents or the LLM's internal knowledge, which is
unreliable and lacks explainability. To address these limitations, we propose a
Mask-Based Membership Inference Attacks (MBA) framework. Our framework first
employs a masking algorithm that effectively masks a certain number of words in
the target document. The masked text is then used to prompt the RAG system, and
the RAG system is required to predict the mask values. If the target document
appears in the knowledge database, the masked text will retrieve the complete
target document as context, allowing for accurate mask prediction. Finally, we
adopt a simple yet effective threshold-based method to infer the membership of
target document by analyzing the accuracy of mask prediction. Our mask-based
approach is more document-specific, making the RAG system's generation less
susceptible to distractions from other documents or the LLM's internal
knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach

simple fine-tuning can reduce the success rate of such attacks to nearly zero.
This makes these attacks impractical since fine-tuning is a common practice

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Knowledge Graphs","Despite the superior performance of Large language models on many NLP tasks,
they still face significant limitations in memorizing extensive world
knowledge. Recent studies have demonstrated that leveraging the
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, combined with Knowledge Graphs
that encapsulate extensive factual data in a structured format, robustly
enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, deploying such systems in
real-world scenarios presents challenges: the continuous evolution of
non-stationary environments may lead to performance degradation and user
satisfaction requires a careful balance of performance and responsiveness. To
address these challenges, we introduce a Multi-objective Multi-Armed Bandit
enhanced RAG framework, supported by multiple retrieval methods with diverse
capabilities under rich and evolving retrieval contexts in practice. Within
this framework, each retrieval method is treated as a distinct ``arm''. The
system utilizes real-time user feedback to adapt to dynamic environments, by
selecting the appropriate retrieval method based on input queries and the
historical multi-objective performance of each arm. Extensive experiments
conducted on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baseline methods in non-stationary settings while

based on query context, the framework prioritizes the most relevant data. For
instance, it gives precedence to product manuals for SKU-specific queries while
incorporating general FAQs for broader issues. The system employs FAISS for
efficient dense vector search, coupled with a dynamic aggregation mechanism to
seamlessly integrate results from multiple sources. A Llama-based
self-evaluator ensures the contextual accuracy and confidence of the generated
responses before delivering them. This iterative cycle of retrieval and
validation enhances precision, diversity, and reliability in response

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation","We introduce EXIT, an extractive context compression framework that enhances
both the effectiveness and efficiency of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
in question answering (QA). Current RAG systems often struggle when retrieval
models fail to rank the most relevant documents, leading to the inclusion of
more context at the expense of latency and accuracy. While abstractive
compression methods can drastically reduce token counts, their token-by-token
generation process significantly increases end-to-end latency. Conversely,
existing extractive methods reduce latency but rely on independent,
non-adaptive sentence selection, failing to fully utilize contextual
information. EXIT addresses these limitations by classifying sentences from
retrieved documents - while preserving their contextual dependencies - enabling
parallelizable, context-aware extraction that adapts to query complexity and
retrieval quality. Our evaluations on both single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks
show that EXIT consistently surpasses existing compression methods and even
uncompressed baselines in QA accuracy, while also delivering substantial
reductions in inference time and token count. By improving both effectiveness
and efficiency, EXIT provides a promising direction for developing scalable,
high-quality QA solutions in RAG pipelines. Our code is available at

issues of outdated and hallucinatory content in the generation of large
language models (LLMs), yet it still reveals numerous limitations. When a
general-purpose LLM serves as the RAG generator, it often suffers from
inadequate response informativeness, response robustness, and citation quality.
Past approaches to tackle these limitations, either by incorporating additional
steps beyond generating responses or optimizing the generator through
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), still failed to align with the RAG requirement
thoroughly. Consequently, optimizing the RAG generator from multiple preference
perspectives while maintaining its end-to-end LLM form remains a challenge. To
bridge this gap, we propose Multiple Perspective Preference Alignment for
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PA-RAG), a method for optimizing the generator
of RAG systems to align with RAG requirements comprehensively. Specifically, we
construct high-quality instruction fine-tuning data and multi-perspective
preference data by sampling varied quality responses from the generator across
different prompt documents quality scenarios. Subsequently, we optimize the
generator using SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive

  Language Models","This paper presents OG-RAG, an Ontology-Grounded Retrieval Augmented
Generation method designed to enhance LLM-generated responses by anchoring
retrieval processes in domain-specific ontologies. While LLMs are widely used
for tasks like question answering and search, they struggle to adapt to
specialized knowledge, such as industrial workflows or knowledge work, without
expensive fine-tuning or sub-optimal retrieval methods. Existing
retrieval-augmented models, such as RAG, offer improvements but fail to account
for structured domain knowledge, leading to suboptimal context generation.
Ontologies, which conceptually organize domain knowledge by defining entities
and their interrelationships, offer a structured representation to address this
gap. OG-RAG constructs a hypergraph representation of domain documents, where
each hyperedge encapsulates clusters of factual knowledge grounded using
domain-specific ontology. An optimization algorithm then retrieves the minimal
set of hyperedges that constructs a precise, conceptually grounded context for
the LLM. This method enables efficient retrieval while preserving the complex
relationships between entities. OG-RAG applies to domains where fact-based
reasoning is essential, particularly in tasks that require workflows or
decision-making steps to follow predefined rules and procedures. These include
industrial workflows in healthcare, legal, and agricultural sectors, as well as
knowledge-driven tasks such as news journalism, investigative research,
consulting and more. Our evaluations demonstrate that OG-RAG increases the
recall of accurate facts by 55% and improves response correctness by 40% across
four different LLMs. Additionally, OG-RAG enables 30% faster attribution of
responses to context and boosts fact-based reasoning accuracy by 27% compared

can reduce inference time compared to approximate retrieval variants because an
exact retrieval model can send a smaller but more accurate list of documents to
the generative model while maintaining the same end-to-end accuracy. This
observation motivates the acceleration of the exact nearest neighbor search for
RAG.

  Method. We manually curated 193 unique scenarios leading to 1283
representative samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the

  Results and Conclusions. Human experts demonstrated higher accuracy, but LLMs
are quicker and more actionable. Moreover, our findings show that RAG-assisted
LLMs have the lowest hallucination rates, effectively uncovering hidden risks

RAG pipeline engineering. This includes fine-tuning embeddings and LLMs,
extracting documents from vector databases, rephrasing queries, reranking
results, designing prompts, honoring document access controls, providing
concise responses, including references, safeguarding personal information, and
building orchestration agents. We present a framework for building RAG-based
chatbots based on our experience with three NVIDIA chatbots: for IT/HR

three-fold: introducing the FACTS framework (Freshness, Architectures, Cost,
Testing, Security), presenting fifteen RAG pipeline control points, and
providing empirical results on accuracy-latency tradeoffs between large and

  with Knowledge-guided Retrieval Augmented Generation","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has improved large language models
(LLMs) by using knowledge retrieval to overcome knowledge deficiencies.
However, current RAG methods often fall short of ensuring the depth and
completeness of retrieved information, which is necessary for complex reasoning
tasks. In this work, we introduce Think-on-Graph 2.0 (ToG-2), a hybrid RAG
framework that iteratively retrieves information from both unstructured and
structured knowledge sources in a tight-coupling manner. Specifically, ToG-2
leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to link documents via entities, facilitating
deep and knowledge-guided context retrieval. Simultaneously, it utilizes
documents as entity contexts to achieve precise and efficient graph retrieval.
ToG-2 alternates between graph retrieval and context retrieval to search for
in-depth clues relevant to the question, enabling LLMs to generate answers. We
conduct a series of well-designed experiments to highlight the following
advantages of ToG-2: 1) ToG-2 tightly couples the processes of context
retrieval and graph retrieval, deepening context retrieval via the KG while
enabling reliable graph retrieval based on contexts; 2) it achieves deep and
faithful reasoning in LLMs through an iterative knowledge retrieval process of
collaboration between contexts and the KG; and 3) ToG-2 is training-free and
plug-and-play compatible with various LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that ToG-2 achieves overall state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on 6 out of 7
knowledge-intensive datasets with GPT-3.5, and can elevate the performance of
smaller models (e.g., LLAMA-2-13B) to the level of GPT-3.5's direct reasoning.

previous RAG systems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited
flexibility, we have developed Radiology RAG (RadioRAG) as an end-to-end
framework that retrieves data from authoritative radiologic online sources in
real-time. RadioRAG is evaluated using a dedicated radiologic
question-and-answer dataset (RadioQA). We evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of
various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions with and without
access to additional online information via RAG. Using 80 questions from RSNA
Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24 additional
expert-curated questions, for which the correct gold-standard answers were
available, LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3 [8B

context-specific information from www.radiopaedia.org in real-time and
incorporated them into its reply. RadioRAG consistently improved diagnostic
accuracy across all LLMs, with relative improvements ranging from 2% to 54%. It
matched or exceeded question answering without RAG across radiologic
subspecialties, particularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology.
However, degree of improvement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and
Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1 saw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2

iterative RAG for medicine (i-MedRAG), where LLMs can iteratively ask follow-up

i-MedRAG, the follow-up queries will be answered by a conventional RAG system

as one of the major struggles in 21st century Uganda - especially in rural
areas. Research identifies several problems, including low quality or absent
teacher lesson planning. As the government pushes towards the implementation of
a new curriculum, exiting lesson plans become obsolete and the problem is
worsened. Using a Retrieval Augmented Generation approach, we developed a
prototype that generates customized lesson plans based on the
government-accredited textbooks. This helps teachers create lesson plans more
efficiently and with better quality, ensuring they are fully aligned the new
curriculum and the competence-based learning approach.
  Methods: The prototype was created using Cohere LLM and Sentence Embeddings,
and LangChain Framework - and thereafter made available on a public website.
Vector stores were trained for three new curriculum textbooks (ICT,
Mathematics, History), all at Secondary 1 Level. Twenty-four lessons plans were
generated following a pseudo-random generation protocol, based on the suggested
periods in the textbooks. The lesson plans were analyzed regarding their
technical quality by three independent raters following the Lesson Plan
Analysis Protocol (LPAP) by Ndihokubwayo et al. (2022) that is specifically
designed for East Africa and competence-based curriculums.
  Results: Evaluation of 24 lesson plans using the LPAP resulted in an average
quality of between 75 and 80%, corresponding to ""very good lesson plan"". None
of the lesson plans scored below 65%, although one lesson plan could be argued
to have been missing the topic. In conclusion, the quality of the generated

underperformance often arises from a failure to correctly identify the core

domain-specific and knowledge-intensive tasks, LLMs suffer from hallucinations,
knowledge cut-offs, and lack of knowledge attributions. Additionally, fine
tuning LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to highly specific domains is an expensive and
time consuming process. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process has
recently emerged as a method capable of optimization of LLM responses, by
referencing them to a predetermined ontology. It was shown that using a
Knowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into
account relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured
manner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM
framework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store
factual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in
the KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of

  Zero-shot Audio Captioning","While automated audio captioning (AAC) has made notable progress, traditional
fully supervised AAC models still face two critical challenges: the need for
expensive audio-text pair data for training and performance degradation when
transferring across domains. To overcome these limitations, we present DRCap, a
data-efficient and flexible zero-shot audio captioning system that requires
text-only data for training and can quickly adapt to new domains without
additional fine-tuning. DRCap integrates a contrastive language-audio
pre-training (CLAP) model and a large-language model (LLM) as its backbone.
During training, the model predicts the ground-truth caption with a fixed text
encoder from CLAP, whereas, during inference, the text encoder is replaced with
the audio encoder to generate captions for audio clips in a zero-shot manner.
To mitigate the modality gap of the CLAP model, we use both the projection
strategy from the encoder side and the retrieval-augmented generation strategy
from the decoder side. Specifically, audio embeddings are first projected onto
a text embedding support to absorb extensive semantic information within the
joint multi-modal space of CLAP. At the same time, similar captions retrieved
from a datastore are fed as prompts to instruct the LLM, incorporating external
knowledge to take full advantage of its strong generative capability.
Conditioned on both the projected CLAP embedding and the retrieved similar
captions, the model is able to produce a more accurate and semantically rich
textual description. By tailoring the text embedding support and the caption
datastore to the target domain, DRCap acquires a robust ability to adapt to new

of OpenAPIs to reduce the input token length while preserving the most relevant

sourcing the most relevant text chunk(s) to base queries upon. Despite the
significant advancements in LLMs' response quality in recent years, users may
still encounter inaccuracies or irrelevant answers; these issues often stem
from suboptimal text chunk retrieval by RAG rather than the inherent
capabilities of LLMs. To augment the efficacy of LLMs, it is crucial to refine
the RAG process. This paper explores the existing constraints of RAG pipelines
and introduces methodologies for enhancing text retrieval. It delves into
strategies such as sophisticated chunking techniques, query expansion, the

decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized

Value (V) pairs over chunks of the text conditioned on the prompt. Only such
pairs are stored in the KV cache, which, within the space constrained by the

command causality, since pretrained models usually work on statistical
associations, and do not focus on causes and effects in sentences. So that
probing internal manipulation of causality is necessary for LLMs. This paper
proposes a novel approach to probe causality manipulation hierarchically, by
providing different shortcuts to models and observe behaviors. We exploit
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL) for models

mainstream LLMs, including GPT-4 and some smaller and domain-specific models.
Our results suggest that LLMs can detect entities related to causality and
recognize direct causal relationships. However, LLMs lack specialized cognition
for causality, merely treating them as part of the global semantic of the

However, they also have a massive number of parameters, resulting in enormous
model sizes, thus making them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constraint

compact-sized (parameter-efficient) deep generative models since the model can
generate one block at a time instead of generating the whole image at once.
However, block-wise generation is also considerably challenging because
ensuring coherence across generated blocks can be non-trivial. To this end, we
design a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach and leverage the
corresponding blocks of the images retrieved by the RAG module to condition the
training and generation stages of a block-wise denoising diffusion model. Our
conditioning schemes ensure coherence across the different blocks during

to comprehend conversational context and manage retrieved passages over
multiple turns. In this work, we propose a method for enabling LLMs to decide
when to retrieve in RAG settings given a conversational context. When retrieval
is deemed necessary, the LLM then rewrites the conversation for passage
retrieval and judges the relevance of returned passages before response
generation. Operationally, we build on the single-turn SELF-RAG framework (Asai

SELF-multi-RAG demonstrates improved capabilities over single-turn variants

encoding and precise retrieval, significantly reducing prompt lengths and
mitigating information loss. We have developed two new million-token benchmarks

retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), makes contextual states (i.e., KV cache)
reusable across user requests. Given the capacity constraints of GPU memory,
only a limited number of contexts can be cached on GPU for reusing. Existing
inference systems typically evict part of the KV cache and restore it by
recomputing it from the original tokens or offloading it to host storage for
later retrieval, both of which introduce substantial computational or I/O
overheads. We propose HCache, a novel LLM state restoration method. Its key
idea is to restore LLM states from intermediate activations and thus utilize
computational and I/O resources with low overhead. We enhance HCache with two
techniques, including i) a bubble-free restoration scheduler that integrates
resource-complementary methods to optimize the balance between computation and
IO tasks; and ii) a chunk-based storage manager to address the layout mismatch
issue (i.e., layer-before-token saving versus token-before-layer restoration).
Our evaluations, conducted using real-world tasks, show that HCache reduces the
TTFT by up to 1.93X compared to KV offload while consuming 1.92-2.40X less
storage space; compared to token recomputation, HCache achieves up to 5.73X

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems deployed in high-stakes domains
such as banking. GLM evaluation is challenging due to open-ended outputs and
subjective quality assessments. Leveraging the structured nature of RAG
systems, where generated responses are grounded in a predefined document
collection, we propose the Human-Calibrated Automated Testing (HCAT) framework.
HCAT integrates a) automated test generation using stratified sampling, b)
embedding-based metrics for explainable assessment of functionality, risk and
safety attributes, and c) a two-stage calibration approach that aligns
machine-generated evaluations with human judgments through probability
calibration and conformal prediction.
  In addition, the framework includes robustness testing to evaluate model
performance against adversarial, out-of-distribution, and varied input
conditions, as well as targeted weakness identification using marginal and
bivariate analysis to pinpoint specific areas for improvement. This
human-calibrated, multi-layered evaluation framework offers a scalable,
transparent, and interpretable approach to GLM assessment, providing a
practical and reliable solution for deploying GLMs in applications where
accuracy, transparency, and regulatory compliance are paramount.",Agus Sudjianto

domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise
handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a
feedback-driven, multi-agent framework that incorporates three proposed
modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved
reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an
error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and
MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%,
respectively, significantly outperforming the latest LLMs (ChatGPT 4o and
o1-preview), which achieved a 27.77% success rate on standard simulation tasks
and 0% on complex tasks. Additionally, our framework also supports rapid,
cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30

We propose a novel approach integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

output by incorporating external knowledge sources, while the Self-Ranking
technique, inspired to the concept of Self-Consistency, generates multiple
reasoning paths and creates ranks to select the most robust detector. Our
extensive empirical study targets code generated by LLMs to detect two
prevalent injection attacks in web security: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL

to output a ranked list of relevant documents. Combining large language models
(LLMs) with embedding-based retrieval models, recent work shows promising
results on the zero-shot retrieval problem, i.e., no access to labeled data
from the target domain. Two such popular paradigms are generation-augmented
retrieval or GAR (generate additional context for the query and then retrieve),
and retrieval-augmented generation or RAG (retrieve relevant documents as
context and then generate answers). The success of these paradigms hinges on
(i) high-recall retrieval models, which are difficult to obtain in the
zero-shot setting, and (ii) high-precision (re-)ranking models which typically
need a good initialization. In this work, we propose a novel GAR-meets-RAG
recurrence formulation that overcomes the challenges of existing paradigms. Our
method iteratively improves retrieval (via GAR) and rewrite (via RAG) stages in
the zero-shot setting. A key design principle is that the rewrite-retrieval
stages improve the recall of the system and a final re-ranking stage improves
the precision. We conduct extensive experiments on zero-shot passage retrieval
benchmarks, BEIR and TREC-DL. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art in

LLMs often invent, or ""hallucinate"", non-existent APIs or produce variants of
already existing code. This paper presents De-Hallucinator, a technique that
grounds the predictions of an LLM through a novel combination of retrieving
suitable API references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly

window can be extended by fine-tuning, it will result in a substantial cost in
both training and inference stage. In this paper, we present Extensible
Tokenization as an alternative method which realizes the flexible scaling of
LLMs' context. Extensible Tokenization stands as a midware in between of the
tokenized context and the LLM, which transforms the raw token embeddings into
the extensible embeddings. Such embeddings provide a more compact
representation for the long context, on top of which the LLM is able to
perceive more information with the same context window. Extensible Tokenization
is also featured by its flexibility: the scaling factor can be flexibly
determined within a feasible scope, leading to the extension of an arbitrary
context length at the inference time. Besides, Extensible Tokenization is
introduced as a drop-in component, which can be seamlessly plugged into not
only the LLM itself and but also its fine-tuned derivatives, bringing in the
extended contextual information while fully preserving the LLM's existing
capabilities. We perform comprehensive experiments on long-context language

factors, such as the relevance of the passages included in the prompt context,
their position, and their number. One counter-intuitive finding of this work is
that the retriever's highest-scoring documents that are not directly relevant

LLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and
inevitably biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and

(RAG) framework of hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can
dynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data

workflow interface. Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates strong tool usage
ability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science
concepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data

responses by LLaMP and vanilla LLMs. Our benchmark shows that LLaMP effectively
mitigates the intrinsic bias in LLMs, counteracting the errors on bulk moduli,
electronic bandgaps, and formation energies that seem to derive from mixed data
sources. We also demonstrate LLaMP's capability to edit crystal structures and
run annealing molecular dynamics simulations using pre-trained machine-learning
force fields. The framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination-free

engines, ranging from specialized (e.g., PubMed) to general (e.g., Google),
based on the nature of user utterances. A critical aspect of federated search
is resource selection - the selection of appropriate resources prior to issuing
the query to ensure high-quality and rapid responses, and contain costs
associated with calling the external search engines. However, current SOTA
resource selection methodologies primarily rely on feature-based learning
approaches. These methods often involve the labour intensive and expensive
creation of training labels for each resource. In contrast, LLMs have exhibited
strong effectiveness as zero-shot methods across NLP and IR tasks. We
hypothesise that in the context of federated search LLMs can assess the
relevance of resources without the need for extensive predefined labels or
features. In this paper, we propose ReSLLM. Our ReSLLM method exploits LLMs to
drive the selection of resources in federated search in a zero-shot setting. In
addition, we devise an unsupervised fine tuning protocol, the Synthetic Label
Augmentation Tuning (SLAT), where the relevance of previously logged queries
and snippets from resources is predicted using an off-the-shelf LLM and then in
turn used to fine-tune ReSLLM with respect to resource selection. Our empirical
evaluation and analysis details the factors influencing the effectiveness of
LLMs in this context. The results showcase the merits of ReSLLM for resource

We design a continuous DocIDs-References-Answer generation strategy, which
facilitates effective and efficient RAG. (3) We employ well-designed
unsupervised DocID understanding tasks, to comprehend DocID semantics and their

precise evidence text due to the challenges of processing lengthy documents and
filtering out irrelevant content. Commonly employed solutions, such as document
chunking and adapting language models to handle longer contexts, have their
limitations. These methods either disrupt the semantic coherence of the text or
fail to effectively address the issues of noise and inaccuracy in evidence

  CFIC addresses these challenges by circumventing the conventional chunking

passages in retrieval, but there has been limited work on evaluating the
utility of passages in supporting question answering. In this work, we conduct
a comprehensive study about the capabilities of LLMs in utility evaluation for
open-domain QA. Specifically, we introduce a benchmarking procedure and
collection of candidate passages with different characteristics, facilitating a
series of experiments with five representative LLMs. Our experiments reveal
that: (i) well-instructed LLMs can distinguish between relevance and utility,
and that LLMs are highly receptive to newly generated counterfactual passages.
Moreover, (ii) we scrutinize key factors that affect utility judgments in the
instruction design. And finally, (iii) to verify the efficacy of utility
judgments in practical retrieval augmentation applications, we delve into LLMs'
QA capabilities using the evidence judged with utility and direct dense
retrieval results. (iv) We propose a k-sampling, listwise approach to reduce
the dependency of LLMs on the sequence of input passages, thereby facilitating
subsequent answer generation. We believe that the way we formalize and study
the problem along with our findings contributes to a critical assessment of
retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our code and benchmark can be found at

  of LLMs","With the rise of large language models (LLMs), ensuring they embody the
principles of being helpful, honest, and harmless (3H), known as Human
Alignment, becomes crucial. While existing alignment methods like RLHF, DPO,
etc., effectively fine-tune LLMs to match preferences in the preference
dataset, they often lead LLMs to highly receptive human input and external
evidence, even when this information is poisoned. This leads to a tendency for
LLMs to be Adaptive Chameleons when external evidence conflicts with their
parametric memory. This exacerbates the risk of LLM being attacked by external
poisoned data, which poses a significant security risk to LLM system
applications such as Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To address the
challenge, we propose a novel framework: Dialectical Alignment (DA), which (1)
utilizes AI feedback to identify optimal strategies for LLMs to navigate
inter-context conflicts and context-memory conflicts with different external
evidence in context window (i.e., different ratios of poisoned factual
contexts); (2) constructs the SFT dataset as well as the preference dataset
based on the AI feedback and strategies above; (3) uses the above datasets for
LLM alignment to defense poisoned context attack while preserving the
effectiveness of in-context knowledge editing. Our experiments show that the
dialectical alignment model improves poisoned data attack defense by 20 and
does not require any additional prompt engineering or prior declaration of
``you may be attacked`` to the LLMs' context window.",Shu Yang

  Graph Construction","In this work, we are interested in automated methods for knowledge graph
creation (KGC) from input text. Progress on large language models (LLMs) has
prompted a series of recent works applying them to KGC, e.g., via zero/few-shot
prompting. Despite successes on small domain-specific datasets, these models
face difficulties scaling up to text common in many real-world applications. A
principal issue is that, in prior methods, the KG schema has to be included in
the LLM prompt to generate valid triplets; larger and more complex schemas
easily exceed the LLMs' context window length. Furthermore, there are scenarios
where a fixed pre-defined schema is not available and we would like the method
to construct a high-quality KG with a succinct self-generated schema. To
address these problems, we propose a three-phase framework named
Extract-Define-Canonicalize (EDC): open information extraction followed by
schema definition and post-hoc canonicalization. EDC is flexible in that it can
be applied to settings where a pre-defined target schema is available and when
it is not; in the latter case, it constructs a schema automatically and applies
self-canonicalization. To further improve performance, we introduce a trained
component that retrieves schema elements relevant to the input text; this
improves the LLMs' extraction performance in a retrieval-augmented
generation-like manner. We demonstrate on three KGC benchmarks that EDC is able
to extract high-quality triplets without any parameter tuning and with
significantly larger schemas compared to prior works. Code for EDC is available

For example, in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system, a retrieval
component might provide a source of ground truth, while a generative component
summarizes and augments its responses. In other systems, a large language model
(LLM) might directly generate responses without consulting a retrieval
component. While there are multiple definitions of generative information
retrieval (Gen-IR) systems, in this paper we focus on those systems where the
system's response is not drawn from a fixed collection of documents or
passages. The response to a query may be entirely new text. Since traditional
IR evaluation methods break down under this model, we explore various methods
that extend traditional offline evaluation approaches to the Gen-IR context.
Offline IR evaluation traditionally employs paid human assessors, but
increasingly LLMs are replacing human assessment, demonstrating capabilities
similar or superior to crowdsourced labels. Given that Gen-IR systems do not
generate responses from a fixed set, we assume that methods for Gen-IR
evaluation must largely depend on LLM-generated labels. Along with methods
based on binary and graded relevance, we explore methods based on explicit
subtopics, pairwise preferences, and embeddings. We first validate these
methods against human assessments on several TREC Deep Learning Track tasks; we
then apply these methods to evaluate the output of several purely generative
systems. For each method we consider both its ability to act autonomously,
without the need for human labels or other input, and its ability to support
human auditing. To trust these methods, we must be assured that their results
align with human assessments. In order to do so, evaluation criteria must be
transparent, so that outcomes can be audited by human assessors.",Negar Arabzadeh

does not guarantee valid responses if retrieval fails to identify the necessary
information as the context for response generation. Also, if there is
contradictory content, the RAG response will likely reflect only one of the two
possible responses. Therefore, quantifying uncertainty in the retrieval process
is crucial for ensuring RAG trustworthiness. In this report, we introduce a
four-step framework for applying conformal prediction to quantify retrieval
uncertainty in RAG frameworks. First, a calibration set of questions answerable
from the knowledge base is constructed. Each question's embedding is compared
against document embeddings to identify the most relevant document chunks
containing the answer and record their similarity scores. Given a
user-specified error rate ({\alpha}), these similarity scores are then analyzed
to determine a similarity score cutoff threshold. During inference, all chunks
with similarity exceeding this threshold are retrieved to provide context to
the LLM, ensuring the true answer is captured in the context with a
(1-{\alpha}) confidence level. We provide a Python package that enables users

first time reference gold explanations written by medical doctors which can be
leveraged to establish various gold-based upper-bounds for comparison with LLMs

that performance of LLMs still has large room for improvement, especially for

abilities of embedding models, and take a conscious look at the reasoning
abilities stored in them. Addressing this, we pose the question: Can retrievers
solve reasoning problems? By transforming reasoning tasks into retrieval tasks,
we find that without specifically trained for reasoning-level language
understanding, current state-of-the-art retriever models may still be far from
being competent for playing the role of assisting LLMs, especially in
reasoning-intensive tasks. Moreover, albeit trained to be aware of
instructions, instruction-aware IR models are often better off without

retriever-LLM behavioral gap for the research community to align. However,
recent decoder-based embedding models show great promise in narrowing the gap,
highlighting the pathway for embedding models to achieve reasoning-level
language understanding. We also show that, although current off-the-shelf
re-ranker models fail on these tasks, injecting reasoning abilities into them
through fine-tuning still appears easier than doing so to bi-encoders, and we
are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance across all tasks by

themselves are rapidly becoming tools for evaluation, with current research
indicating that LLMs may be superior to crowdsource workers and other paid
assessors on basic relevance judgement tasks. We review past and ongoing
related research, including speculation on the future of shared task

evaluation of GenIR systems to be at least partially based on LLM-based
assessment, creating an apparent circularity, with a system seemingly
evaluating its own output. We resolve this apparent circularity in two ways: 1)
by viewing LLM-based assessment as a form of ""slow search"", where a slower IR
system is used for evaluation and training of a faster production IR system;
and 2) by recognizing a continuing need to ground evaluation in human
assessment, even if the characteristics of that human assessment must change.",Marwah Alaofi

domains globally. However, their inclusivity and effectiveness remain limited
for non-Latin scripts and low-resource languages. This paper tackles the
imperative challenge of enhancing the multilingual performance of LLMs without
extensive training or fine-tuning. Through systematic investigation and
evaluation of diverse languages using popular question-answering (QA) datasets,
we present novel techniques that unlock the true potential of LLMs in a
polyglot landscape. Our approach encompasses three key strategies that yield
significant improvements in multilingual proficiency. First, by meticulously
optimizing prompts tailored for polyglot LLMs, we unlock their latent
capabilities, resulting in substantial performance boosts across languages.
Second, we introduce a new hybrid approach that synergizes LLM Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) with multilingual embeddings and achieves improved
multilingual task performance. Finally, we introduce a novel learning approach
that dynamically selects the optimal prompt strategy, LLM model, and embedding
model per query at run-time. This dynamic adaptation maximizes the efficacy of
LLMs across languages, outperforming best static and random strategies.
Additionally, our approach adapts configurations in both offline and online
settings, and can seamlessly adapt to new languages and datasets, leading to
substantial advancements in multilingual understanding and generation across
diverse languages.",Somnath Kumar

Answering over KGs (KGQA) is the task of answering natural questions grounding
the reasoning to the information provided by the KG. Large Language Models
(LLMs) are the state-of-the-art models for QA tasks due to their remarkable
ability to understand natural language. On the other hand, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for KGQA as they can handle the complex
graph information stored in the KG. In this work, we introduce GNN-RAG, a novel
method for combining language understanding abilities of LLMs with the
reasoning abilities of GNNs in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style.
First, a GNN reasons over a dense KG subgraph to retrieve answer candidates for
a given question. Second, the shortest paths in the KG that connect question
entities and answer candidates are extracted to represent KG reasoning paths.
The extracted paths are verbalized and given as input for LLM reasoning with
RAG. In our GNN-RAG framework, the GNN acts as a dense subgraph reasoner to
extract useful graph information, while the LLM leverages its natural language
processing ability for ultimate KGQA. Furthermore, we develop a retrieval
augmentation (RA) technique to further boost KGQA performance with GNN-RAG.
Experimental results show that GNN-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in
two widely used KGQA benchmarks (WebQSP and CWQ), outperforming or matching

hinder the LLMs' capacity to generate comprehensive and high-quality responses.
Prior RAG studies on the robustness of retrieval noises often confine
themselves to a limited set of noise types, deviating from real-world retrieval

multi-task learning to ensure the model's capacity to internally recognize
noisy contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LLaMA-2 7B model

  Memory","There has recently been growing interest in conversational agents with
long-term memory which has led to the rapid development of language models that

focused on information retrieval from large databases of texts, like Wikipedia,
rather than information from long-form conversations. In this paper, we argue
that effective retrieval from long-form conversational data faces two unique
problems compared to static database retrieval: 1) time/event-based queries,
which requires the model to retrieve information about previous conversations
based on time or the order of a conversational event (e.g., the third
conversation on Tuesday), and 2) ambiguous queries that require surrounding
conversational context to understand. To better develop RAG-based agents that
can deal with these challenges, we generate a new dataset of ambiguous and
time-based questions that build upon a recent dataset of long-form, simulated
conversations, and demonstrate that standard RAG based approaches handle such
questions poorly. We then develop a novel retrieval model which combines
chained-of-table search methods, standard vector-database retrieval, and a
prompting method to disambiguate queries, and demonstrate that this approach
substantially improves over current methods at solving these tasks. We believe
that this new dataset and more advanced RAG agent can act as a key benchmark

weak to no correspondence with the visuals -- resulting in uncontrolled ambient
sounds or hallucinations at test time. We propose a novel ambient-aware audio

learn to disentangle foreground action sounds from the ambient background
sounds in in-the-wild training videos. Given a novel silent video, our model
uses retrieval-augmented generation to create audio that matches the visual

Our model outperforms an array of existing methods, allows controllable

  Materials and Methods: We utilized OpenAI's GPT-4 model within a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, enriched with a business
context document, to transform NLQs into syntactically precise SQL queries.
Each NLQ was presented to the LLM randomly and independently to prevent

The common retrievers like DPR normally work with 100-word Wikipedia
paragraphs. Such a design forces the retriever to search over a large corpus to
find the `needle' unit. In contrast, the readers only need to generate answers
from the short retrieved units. The imbalanced `heavy' retriever and `light'
reader design can lead to sub-optimal performance. The loss of contextual
information in the short, chunked units may increase the likelihood of
introducing hard negatives during the retrieval stage. Additionally, the reader
might not fully leverage the capabilities of recent advancements in LLMs. In
order to alleviate the imbalance, we propose a new framework LongRAG,
consisting of a `long retriever' and a `long reader'. In the two
Wikipedia-based datasets, NQ and HotpotQA, LongRAG processes the entire
Wikipedia corpus into 4K-token units by grouping related documents. By
increasing the unit size, we significantly reduce the total number of units.
This greatly reduces the burden on the retriever, resulting in strong retrieval
performance with only a few (less than 8) top units. Without requiring any
training, LongRAG achieves an EM of 62.7% on NQ and 64.3% on HotpotQA, which
are on par with the (fully-trained) SoTA model. Furthermore, we test on two
non-Wikipedia-based datasets, Qasper and MultiFieldQA-en. LongRAG processes
each individual document as a single (long) unit rather than chunking them into
smaller units. By doing so, we achieve an F1 score of 25.9% on Qasper and 57.5%

Second, we mitigate this positional bias through a calibration mechanism,
found-in-the-middle, that allows the model to attend to contexts faithfully
according to their relevance, even though when they are in the middle. Third,
we show found-in-the-middle not only achieves better performance in locating

reducing dependence on expensive human-generated datasets. Despite this,
challenges remain in the areas of generalization, controllability, diversity,
and truthfulness within the existing generative frameworks. To address these
challenges, this paper presents UniGen, a comprehensive LLM-powered framework
designed to produce diverse, accurate, and highly controllable datasets. UniGen
is adaptable, supporting all types of text datasets and enhancing the
generative process through innovative mechanisms. To augment data diversity,
UniGen incorporates an attribute-guided generation module and a group checking
feature. For accuracy, it employs a code-based mathematical assessment for
label verification alongside a retrieval-augmented generation technique for
factual validation. The framework also allows for user-specified constraints,
enabling customization of the data generation process to suit particular
requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of data
generated by UniGen, and each module within UniGen plays a critical role in
this enhancement. Additionally, UniGen is applied in two practical scenarios:
benchmarking LLMs and data augmentation. The results indicate that UniGen
effectively supports dynamic and evolving benchmarking, and that data
augmentation improves LLM capabilities in various domains, including
agent-oriented abilities and reasoning skills.",Siyuan Wu

  Context-Augmented Multimodal LLMs","Synthetic data generation has gained significant attention recently for its
utility in training large vision and language models. However, the application
of synthetic data to the training of multimodal context-augmented generation
systems has been relatively unexplored. This gap in existing work is important
because existing vision and language models (VLMs) are not trained specifically
for context-augmented generation. Resources for adapting such models are
therefore crucial for enabling their use in retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) settings, where a retriever is used to gather relevant information that
is then subsequently provided to a generative model via context augmentation.
To address this challenging problem, we generate SK-VQA: a large synthetic
multimodal dataset containing over 2 million question-answer pairs which
require external knowledge to determine the final answer. Our dataset is both
larger and significantly more diverse than existing resources of its kind,
possessing over 11x more unique questions and containing images from a greater
variety of sources than previously-proposed datasets. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our synthetic dataset can not only serve as a
challenging benchmark, but is also highly effective for adapting existing
generative multimodal models for context-augmented generation.",Xin Su

improved generation quality. This issue becomes particularly evident due to the
sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) to the ordering of few-shot
prompts, which can affect model performance. To address this challenge,
aligning LLM outputs with human preferences using structured feedback, such as
options to copy, regenerate, or dislike, offers a promising method for
improvement. This feedback is applied to the entire list of inputs rather than
giving specific ratings for individual documents, making it a Listwide Labels
Learning-to-Rank task.
  To address this task, we propose Pistis-RAG, a new RAG framework designed
with a content-centric approach to better align LLMs with human preferences.
Pistis-RAG effectively utilizes human feedback, enhancing content ranking and
generation quality. To validate our framework, we use public datasets to
simulate human feedback, allowing us to evaluate and refine our method
effectively. Experimental results indicate that Pistis-RAG improves alignment
with human preferences relative to the baseline RAG system, showing a 6.06%
increase in MMLU (English) and a 7.08% increase in C-EVAL (Chinese) accuracy

efforts have been directed towards adapting ChatGPT for token-level NER.
However, there is a significant research gap when it comes to employing
token-level NER for clinical texts, especially with the use of local

effectiveness of both proprietary and local LLMs in token-level clinical NER.
Essentially, we delve into the capabilities of these models through a series of

MLLMs can support multi-modal inputs and generate diverse types of content by
leveraging large-scale training on vast amounts of multi-modal data. However,
critical challenges persist in developing medical MLLMs, including security and

framework leverages a hierarchical cross-chain architecture to facilitate
secure data training. Moreover, it enhances the output quality of MLLMs through
hybrid RAG, which employs multi-modal metrics to filter various unimodal RAG
results and incorporates these retrieval results as additional inputs to MLLMs.
Additionally, we employ age of information to indirectly evaluate the data
freshness impact of MLLMs and utilize contract theory to incentivize healthcare
data holders to share their fresh data, mitigating information asymmetry during

this cost by equipping LLMs with explicit memory, a memory format cheaper than

with most of its knowledge externalized to explicit memories, the LLM can enjoy
a smaller parameter size, training cost, and inference cost, all proportional
to the amount of remaining ""abstract knowledge"". As a preliminary proof of
concept, we train from scratch a 2.4B LLM, which achieves better performance
than much larger LLMs as well as RAG models, and maintains higher decoding
speed than RAG. The model is named $\text{Memory}^3$, since explicit memory is
the third form of memory in LLMs after implicit memory (model parameters) and

years with the advent of Large Language Models(LLMs). While generation for
general-purpose languages like C, C++, and Python has improved significantly,
LLMs struggle with custom function names in Domain Specific Languages or DSLs.
This leads to higher hallucination rates and syntax errors, specially for DSLs
having a high number of custom function names. Additionally, constant updates
to function names add to the challenge as LLMs need to stay up-to-date. In this
paper, we present optimizations for using Retrieval Augmented Generation (or
RAG) with LLMs for DSL generation along with an ablation study comparing these
strategies. We generated a train as well as test dataset with a DSL to
represent automation tasks across roughly 700 APIs in public domain. We used
the training dataset to fine-tune a Codex model for this DSL. Our results
showed that the fine-tuned model scored the best on code similarity metric.
With our RAG optimizations, we achieved parity for similarity metric. The

Various program scripts have been introduced to automate this process. But the
resulting codes usually contain many issues that should be manually repaired by
developers. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automate
code generation, they can also be used for automated program repair in HLS.
However, due to the limited training of LLMs considering hardware and software
simultaneously, hallucinations may occur during program repair using LLMs,
leading to compilation failures. Besides, using LLMs for iterative repair also
incurs a high cost. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-driven
program repair framework that takes regular C/C++ code as input and
automatically generates its corresponding HLS-C code for synthesis while
minimizing human repair effort. To mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs and
enhance the prompt quality, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm is
introduced to guide the LLMs toward correct repair. In addition, we use LLMs to
create a static bit width optimization program to identify the optimized bit
widths for variables. Moreover, LLM-driven HLS optimization strategies are
introduced to add/tune pragmas in HLS-C programs for circuit optimization.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-driven automated

the system are (1) an Information Retrieval system combining semantic and
lexical search techniques over scientific papers (PubMed), (2) a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module using fine-tuned generative model

and the article from which the claim was derived, verifying whether there may
have been any hallucinations in generating the claim. By leveraging the
Information Retrieval and RAG modules, Verif.ai excels in generating factual
information from a vast array of scientific sources. At the same time, the
Verification engine rigorously double-checks this output, ensuring its accuracy

  Forecasting","Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in
various data mining tasks, such as knowledge question answering, mathematical
reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. However, the reasoning capability of LLMs
on temporal event forecasting has been under-explored. To systematically
investigate their abilities in temporal event forecasting, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based methods for temporal event forecasting.
Due to the lack of a high-quality dataset that involves both graph and textual
data, we first construct a benchmark dataset, named MidEast-TE-mini. Based on
this dataset, we design a series of baseline methods, characterized by various
input formats and retrieval augmented generation(RAG) modules. From extensive
experiments, we find that directly integrating raw texts into the input of LLMs
does not enhance zero-shot extrapolation performance. In contrast,
incorporating raw texts in specific complex events and fine-tuning LLMs
significantly improves performance. Moreover, enhanced with retrieval modules,
LLM can effectively capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical
events. Meanwhile, issues such as popularity bias and the long-tail problem
still persist in LLMs, particularly in the RAG-based method. These findings not

  Bases","LLM agents have demonstrated remarkable performance across various
applications, primarily due to their advanced capabilities in reasoning,
utilizing external knowledge and tools, calling APIs, and executing actions to
interact with environments. Current agents typically utilize a memory module or
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism, retrieving past knowledge and
instances with similar embeddings from knowledge bases to inform task planning
and execution. However, the reliance on unverified knowledge bases raises
significant concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. To uncover such
vulnerabilities, we propose a novel red teaming approach AgentPoison, the first
backdoor attack targeting generic and RAG-based LLM agents by poisoning their
long-term memory or RAG knowledge base. In particular, we form the trigger
generation process as a constrained optimization to optimize backdoor triggers
by mapping the triggered instances to a unique embedding space, so as to ensure
that whenever a user instruction contains the optimized backdoor trigger, the
malicious demonstrations are retrieved from the poisoned memory or knowledge
base with high probability. In the meantime, benign instructions without the
trigger will still maintain normal performance. Unlike conventional backdoor
attacks, AgentPoison requires no additional model training or fine-tuning, and
the optimized backdoor trigger exhibits superior transferability, in-context
coherence, and stealthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentPoison's
effectiveness in attacking three types of real-world LLM agents: RAG-based
autonomous driving agent, knowledge-intensive QA agent, and healthcare
EHRAgent. On each agent, AgentPoison achieves an average attack success rate
higher than 80% with minimal impact on benign performance (less than 1%) with a
poison rate less than 0.1%.",Zhaorun Chen

responses. Such RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems retrieve from
massive heterogeneous data stores that are usually architected as multiple
indexes or APIs instead of a single monolithic source. For a given query,
relevant evidence needs to be retrieved from one or a small subset of possible
retrieval sources. Complex queries can even require multi-step retrieval. For
example, a conversational agent on a retail site answering customer questions
about past orders will need to retrieve the appropriate customer order first
and then the evidence relevant to the customer's question in the context of the
ordered product. Most RAG Agents handle such Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks by
interleaving reasoning and retrieval steps. However, each reasoning step
directly adds to the latency of the system. For large models this latency cost
is significant -- in the order of multiple seconds. Multi-agent systems may
classify the query to a single Agent associated with a retrieval source, though
this means that a (small) classification model dictates the performance of a
large language model. In this work we present REAPER (REAsoning-based PlannER)
- an LLM based planner to generate retrieval plans in conversational systems.

methods face challenges due to the lack of labeled data for training.
Therefore, we propose RLCoder, a novel reinforcement learning framework, which
can enable the retriever to learn to retrieve useful content for code
completion without the need for labeled data. Specifically, we iteratively
evaluate the usefulness of retrieved content based on the perplexity of the

enables the retriever to learn from its successes and failures, gradually
improving its ability to retrieve relevant and high-quality content.
Considering that not all situations require information beyond code files and
not all retrieved context is helpful for generation, we also introduce a stop
signal mechanism, allowing the retriever to decide when to retrieve and which
candidates to retain autonomously. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that RLCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CrossCodeEval

operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of
businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based
systems are unclear.
  In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security
vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and
confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a
vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG,
corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a
vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism
during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be
exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately
impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the
root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based

responses. Despite its growing popularity due to its flexibility and low cost,
the security implications of RAG have not been extensively studied. The data
for such systems are often collected from public sources, providing an attacker
a gateway for indirect prompt injections to manipulate the responses of the
model. In this paper, we investigate the security of RAG systems against
end-to-end indirect prompt manipulations. First, we review existing RAG
framework pipelines, deriving a prototypical architecture and identifying
critical parameters. We then examine prior works searching for techniques that
attackers can use to perform indirect prompt manipulations. Finally, we
implemented Rag 'n Roll, a framework to determine the effectiveness of attacks
against end-to-end RAG applications. Our results show that existing attacks are
mostly optimized to boost the ranking of malicious documents during the
retrieval phase. However, a higher rank does not immediately translate into a
reliable attack. Most attacks, against various configurations, settle around a
40% success rate, which could rise to 60% when considering ambiguous answers as
successful attacks (those that include the expected benign one as well).
Additionally, when using unoptimized documents, attackers deploying two of them
(or more) for a target query can achieve similar results as those using
optimized ones. Finally, exploration of the configuration space of a RAG showed
limited impact in thwarting the attacks, where the most successful combination
severely undermines functionality.",Gianluca De Stefano

(1) R-BAI is used to identify and select anomalous digital artefacts based on
predefined rules. (2) The selected artefacts are then transformed into
embeddings for processing by an LLM with the assistance of a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. The LLM uses its capabilities to
perform automated TA on the artefacts and predict potential incident outcomes.
To validate the framework, we evaluated its performance, efficiency, and

  Comparison of Embedding Models and Pooling Strategies","Objective: Applying large language models (LLMs) to the clinical domain is
challenging due to the context-heavy nature of processing medical records.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution by facilitating
reasoning over large text sources. However, there are many parameters to
optimize in just the retrieval system alone. This paper presents an ablation
study exploring how different embedding models and pooling methods affect
information retrieval for the clinical domain.
  Methods: Evaluating on three retrieval tasks on two electronic health record
(EHR) data sources, we compared seven models, including medical- and
general-domain models, specialized encoder embedding models, and off-the-shelf
decoder LLMs. We also examine the choice of embedding pooling strategy for each
model, independently on the query and the text to retrieve.
  Results: We found that the choice of embedding model significantly impacts
retrieval performance, with BGE, a comparatively small general-domain model,
consistently outperforming all others, including medical-specific models.
However, our findings also revealed substantial variability across datasets and
query text phrasings. We also determined the best pooling methods for each of
these models to guide future design of retrieval systems.
  Discussion: The choice of embedding model, pooling strategy, and query
formulation can significantly impact retrieval performance and the performance
of these models on other public benchmarks does not necessarily transfer to new
domains. Further studies such as this one are vital for guiding
empirically-grounded development of retrieval frameworks, such as in the
context of RAG, for the clinical domain.",Skatje Myers

increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context. Instead,
Block-Attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each
block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final
block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention
enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before,
thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during
inference. The implementation of Block-Attention involves block segmentation,
position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention
mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block
fine-tuning, the Block-Attention model achieves performance comparable to
self-attention models (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even superior performance
(62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral). Notably, Block-Attention significantly reduces
the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very
low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence
with a total length of 32K. Compared to the self-attention models, the time

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating an external
information retrieval system, supplying additional context along with the query

still remain, as the model may rely on irrelevant documents or extrapolate
incorrectly from its training knowledge. To assess and improve the performance
of both the retrieval system and the LLM in a RAG framework, we propose
\textbf{VERA} (\textbf{V}alidation and \textbf{E}nhancement for
\textbf{R}etrieval \textbf{A}ugmented systems), a system designed to: 1)
Evaluate and enhance the retrieved context before response generation, and 2)
Evaluate and refine the LLM-generated response to ensure precision and minimize

external retrieval is necessary, evaluates the relevance and redundancy of the
retrieved context, and refines it to eliminate non-essential information.
Post-response generation, VERA splits the response into atomic statements,
assesses their relevance to the query, and ensures adherence to the context.
Our experiments demonstrate VERA's remarkable efficacy not only in improving
the performance of smaller open-source models, but also larger state-of-the art

  Large Language Models","Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and demonstrated
impressive capabilities. In-Context Learning (ICL) and Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) are currently two mainstream methods for augmenting LLMs to
downstream tasks. ICL typically constructs a few-shot learning scenario, either
manually or by setting up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system,
helping models quickly grasp domain knowledge or question-answering patterns
without changing model parameters. However, this approach involves trade-offs,
such as slower inference speed and increased space occupancy. PEFT assists the
model in adapting to tasks through minimal parameter modifications, but the
training process still demands high hardware requirements, even with a small
number of parameters involved. To address these challenges, we propose
Reference Trustable Decoding (RTD), a paradigm that allows models to quickly
adapt to new tasks without fine-tuning, maintaining low inference costs. RTD
constructs a reference datastore from the provided training examples and
optimizes the LLM's final vocabulary distribution by flexibly selecting
suitable references based on the input, resulting in more trustable responses
and enabling the model to adapt to downstream tasks at a low cost. Experimental
evaluations on various LLMs using different benchmarks demonstrate that RTD
establishes a new paradigm for augmenting models to downstream tasks.

allowing for concurrent usage. Our code can be found at

their construction process, we find the issues of construction efficiency. To
address these issues, we propose a new construction framework with a novel
pruning strategy for edge selection, which accelerates RNG construction while
keeping its $k$-ANN search performance. Then, we integrate this framework into
NSWG construction to enhance both the construction efficiency and $k$-ANN

  Dependency Validation","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an umbrella of different components,
design decisions, and domain-specific adaptations to enhance the capabilities
of large language models and counter their limitations regarding hallucination

lead to a satisfactory performance, developing RAG systems is often
experimental and needs to follow a systematic and sound methodology to gain
sound and reliable results. However, there is currently no generally accepted
methodology for RAG evaluation despite a growing interest in this technology.
In this paper, we propose a first blueprint of a methodology for a sound and
reliable evaluation of RAG systems and demonstrate its applicability on a
real-world software engineering research task: the validation of configuration
dependencies across software technologies. In summary, we make two novel
contributions: (i) A novel, reusable methodological design for evaluating RAG
systems, including a demonstration that represents a guideline, and (ii) a RAG
system, which has been developed following this methodology, that achieves the
highest accuracy in the field of dependency validation. For the blueprint's
demonstration, the key insights are the crucial role of choosing appropriate

from qualitative failure analysis, as well as the reporting practices of key

digesting and reasoning over complex information pieces. In practice,
long-context capabilities are typically built into a pre-trained language
model~(LM) through a carefully designed context extension stage, with the goal
of producing generalist long-context capabilities. In our preliminary
experiments, however, we discovered that the current open-weight generalist
long-context models are still lacking in practical long-context processing
tasks. While this means perfectly effective long-context modeling demands
task-specific data, the cost can be prohibitive. In this paper, we draw
inspiration from how humans process a large body of information: a lossy
\textbf{retrieval} stage ranks a large set of documents while the reader ends
up reading deeply only the top candidates. We build an \textbf{automatic} data
synthesis pipeline that mimics this process using short-context LMs. The
short-context LMs are further tuned using these self-generated data to obtain
task-specific long-context capabilities. Similar to how pre-training learns
from imperfect data, we hypothesize and further demonstrate that the
short-context model can bootstrap over the synthetic data, outperforming not
only long-context generalist models but also the retrieval and read pipeline
used to synthesize the training data in real-world tasks such as long-context

  Nays!","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge bases, achieving state-of-the-art results in
various coding tasks. The core of RAG is retrieving demonstration examples,
which is essential to balance effectiveness (generation quality) and efficiency
(retrieval time) for optimal performance. However, the high-dimensional nature
of code representations and large knowledge bases often create efficiency
bottlenecks, which are overlooked in previous research. This paper
systematically evaluates the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off of retrievers
across three coding tasks: Program Synthesis, Commit Message Generation, and
Assertion Generation. We examined six retrievers: two sparse (BM25 and BM25L)
and four dense retrievers, including one exhaustive dense retriever (SBERT's
Semantic Search) and three approximate dense retrievers (ANNOY, LSH, and HNSW).
Our findings show that while BM25 excels in effectiveness, it suffers in
efficiency as the knowledge base grows beyond 1000 entries. In large-scale
retrieval, efficiency differences become more pronounced, with approximate
dense retrievers offering the greatest gains. For instance, in Commit
Generation task, HNSW achieves a 44x speed up, while only with a 1.74% drop in
RougeL compared with BM25. Our results also show that increasing the number of
demonstrations in the prompt doesn't always improve the effectiveness and can
increase latency and lead to incorrect outputs. Our findings provide valuable
insights for practitioners aiming to build efficient and effective RAG systems

Similarly, methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which leverage
vectorized databases, have further improved model performance by grounding

notable success, they often require extensive training or labeled data, which
can limit their adaptability in resource-constrained environments. To address
these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-based Parameter Ensemble (RPE), a new

retrieval and application of model adaptations to new tasks. RPE minimizes the
need for extensive training and eliminates the requirement for labeled data,
making it particularly effective for zero-shot learning. Additionally, RPE is
well-suited for privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare, as it modifies model
parameters without accessing raw data. When applied to tasks such as medical
report generation and image segmentation, RPE not only proved effective but
also surpassed supervised fine-tuning methods in certain cases, highlighting
its potential to enhance both computational efficiency and privacy in deep

models understand a wide range of semantic abstractions but improperly weigh
these attributes and thus make inferences misaligned with human perception.
While vision representations have previously benefited from alignment in
contexts like image generation, the utility of perceptually aligned
representations in more general-purpose settings remains unclear. Here, we
investigate how aligning vision model representations to human perceptual
judgments impacts their usability across diverse computer vision tasks. We
finetune state-of-the-art models on human similarity judgments for image
triplets and evaluate them across standard vision benchmarks. We find that
aligning models to perceptual judgments yields representations that improve
upon the original backbones across many downstream tasks, including counting,
segmentation, depth estimation, instance retrieval, and retrieval-augmented
generation. In addition, we find that performance is widely preserved on other
tasks, including specialized out-of-distribution domains such as in medical

  Operations on Massive Textual Data","The rapid increase in textual information means we need more efficient
methods to sift through, organize, and understand it all. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models excel in accessing information from
large document collections, they struggle with complex tasks that require
aggregation and reasoning over information spanning across multiple
documents--what we call holistic reasoning. Long-context language models
(LCLMs) have great potential for managing large-scale documents, but their
holistic reasoning capabilities remain unclear. In this work, we introduce
HoloBench, a novel framework that brings database reasoning operations into
text-based contexts, making it easier to systematically evaluate how LCLMs
handle holistic reasoning across large documents. Our approach adjusts key
factors such as context length, information density, distribution of
information, and query complexity to evaluate LCLMs comprehensively. Our
experiments show that the amount of information in the context has a bigger
influence on LCLM performance than the actual context length. Furthermore, the
complexity of queries affects performance more than the amount of information,
particularly for different types of queries. Interestingly, queries that
involve finding maximum or minimum values are easier for LCLMs and are less
affected by context length, even though they pose challenges for RAG systems.
However, tasks requiring the aggregation of multiple pieces of information show
a noticeable drop in accuracy as context length increases. Additionally, we
find that while grouping relevant information generally improves performance,
the optimal positioning varies across models. Our findings surface both the
advancements and the ongoing challenges in achieving a holistic understanding

  Models","Attributing answers to source documents is an approach used to enhance the
verifiability of a model's output in retrieval augmented generation (RAG).
Prior work has mainly focused on improving and evaluating the attribution
quality of large language models (LLMs) in RAG, but this may come at the
expense of inducing biases in the attribution of answers. We define and examine
two aspects in the evaluation of LLMs in RAG pipelines, namely attribution
sensitivity and bias with respect to authorship information. We explicitly
inform an LLM about the authors of source documents, instruct it to attribute
its answers, and analyze (i) how sensitive the LLM's output is to the author of
source documents, and (ii) whether the LLM exhibits a bias towards
human-written or AI-generated source documents. We design an experimental setup
in which we use counterfactual evaluation to study three LLMs in terms of their
attribution sensitivity and bias in RAG pipelines. Our results show that adding
authorship information to source documents can significantly change the
attribution quality of LLMs by 3% to 18%. Moreover, we show that LLMs can have
an attribution bias towards explicit human authorship, which can serve as a
competing hypothesis for findings of prior work that shows that LLM-generated
content may be preferred over human-written contents. Our findings indicate
that metadata of source documents can influence LLMs' trust, and how they

chunking within its pipeline, which impacts the quality of knowledge-intensive
tasks. This paper introduces the concept of Meta-Chunking, which refers to a
granularity between sentences and paragraphs, consisting of a collection of
sentences within a paragraph that have deep linguistic logical connections. To
implement Meta-Chunking, we designed Perplexity (PPL) Chunking, which balances
performance and speed, and precisely identifies the boundaries of text chunks
by analyzing the characteristics of context perplexity distribution.
Additionally, considering the inherent complexity of different texts, we
propose a strategy that combines PPL Chunking with dynamic merging to achieve a
balance between fine-grained and coarse-grained text chunking. Experiments
conducted on eleven datasets demonstrate that Meta-Chunking can more
efficiently improve the performance of single-hop and multi-hop question
answering based on RAG. For instance, on the 2WikiMultihopQA dataset, it
outperforms similarity chunking by 1.32 while only consuming 45.8% of the time.
Furthermore, through the analysis of models of various scales and types, we
observed that PPL Chunking exhibits notable flexibility and adaptability. Our

handle named entities, we introduce retrieval-augmented correction by
augmenting the input with entities retrieved from a database. Our approach is
simple, scalable, and both domain- and language-agnostic. We experiment on

forms property relationships between focal method and other methods, thereby
expanding the scope of retrieval beyond traditional RAG. We implement this

property retrieval, and unit test generation, using an iterative strategy where
newly generated tests guide the creation of subsequent ones. We evaluated APT
on 12 open-source projects with 1515 methods, and the results demonstrate that
APT consistently outperforms existing tools in terms of correctness,

breeding ground for misinformation. With the emergence of large language
models, significant research has gone into curbing this misinformation problem
with automatic false claim detection for text. Unfortunately, the automatic
detection of misinformation in SFV is a more complex problem that remains
largely unstudied. While text samples are monomodal (only containing words),
SFVs comprise three different modalities: words, visuals, and non-linguistic
audio. In this work, we introduce Video Masked Autoencoders for Misinformation
Guarding (ViMGuard), the first deep-learning architecture capable of
fact-checking an SFV through analysis of all three of its constituent
modalities. ViMGuard leverages a dual-component system. First, Video and Audio
Masked Autoencoders analyze the visual and non-linguistic audio elements of a
video to discern its intention; specifically whether it intends to make an
informative claim. If it is deemed that the SFV has informative intent, it is
passed through our second component: a Retrieval Augmented Generation system
that validates the factual accuracy of spoken words. In evaluation, ViMGuard
outperformed three cutting-edge fact-checkers, thus setting a new standard for
SFV fact-checking and marking a significant stride toward trustworthy news on
social platforms. To promote further testing and iteration, VimGuard was
deployed into a Chrome extension and all code was open-sourced on GitHub.",Andrew Kan

increasingly valuable for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications

methods predominantly rely on prompt-based approaches, which are inefficient
for processing large-scale corpora. These approaches often suffer from
information loss, particularly with long documents, due to the lack of
specialized design for KG construction. Additionally, there is a gap in
evaluation datasets and methodologies for ontology-free KG construction. To
overcome these limitations, we propose SynthKG, a multi-step, document-level
ontology-free KG synthesis workflow based on LLMs. By fine-tuning a smaller LLM
on the synthesized document-KG pairs, we streamline the multi-step process into
a single-step KG generation approach called Distill-SynthKG, substantially
reducing the number of LLM inference calls. Furthermore, we re-purpose existing
question-answering datasets to establish KG evaluation datasets and introduce
new evaluation metrics. Using KGs produced by Distill-SynthKG, we also design a
novel graph-based retrieval framework for RAG. Experimental results demonstrate
that Distill-SynthKG not only surpasses all baseline models in KG quality --
including models up to eight times larger -- but also consistently excels in

also outperforms all KG-retrieval methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

standard for developing LLM-based approaches in geospatial data analysis tasks.
Our findings suggest that relying solely on knowledge of LLM is insufficient
for accurate geospatial task programming, which requires coherent multi-step
processes and multiple function calls. Compared to the baseline LLMs, the

confabulation of large language models (LLMs) for question answering by
retrieving and providing additional context coming from external knowledge
sources (e.g., by adding the context to the prompt). However, injecting
incorrect information can mislead the LLM to generate an incorrect answer.
  In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of four LLMs
against misinformation - Gemma 2, GPT-4o-mini, Llama~3.1, and Mixtral - in
answering biomedical questions. We assess the answer accuracy on yes-no and
free-form questions in three scenarios: vanilla LLM answers (no context is

prompt-injection attacks (incorrect context is provided). Our results show that
Llama 3.1 (70B parameters) achieves the highest accuracy in both vanilla

the models almost disappears with ""perfect"" RAG, suggesting its potential to
mitigate the LLM's size-related effectiveness differences.
  We further evaluate the ability of the LLMs to generate malicious context on
one hand and the LLM's robustness against prompt-injection attacks on the other
hand, using metrics such as attack success rate (ASR), accuracy under attack,
and accuracy drop. As adversaries, we use the same four LLMs (Gemma 2,

fine-tuning LLMs with synthetically generated long-context data in a
post-training stage. However, it remains unclear how and why this synthetic
context extension imparts abilities for downstream long-context tasks. In this
paper, we investigate fine-tuning on synthetic data for three long-context
tasks that require retrieval and reasoning. We vary the realism of ""needle""
concepts to be retrieved and diversity of the surrounding ""haystack"" context,
from using LLMs to construct synthetic documents to using templated relations

fall short of the real data, but surprisingly, the mismatch can be interpreted
and even predicted in terms of a special set of attention heads that are
responsible for retrieval over long context: retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2024).
The retrieval heads learned on synthetic data are mostly subsets of the
retrieval heads learned on real data, and there is a strong correlation between
the recall of heads learned and the downstream performance of a model.
Furthermore, with attention knockout and activation patching, we
mechanistically show that retrieval heads are necessary and explain model

role-playing agents in various applications, such as chatbots that can engage
in natural conversations with users and virtual assistants that can provide
personalized support and guidance. The crucial factor in the role-playing task
is the effective utilization of character memory, which stores characters'

experienced during learning, we propose a novel emotion-aware memory retrieval
framework, termed Emotional RAG, which recalls the related memory with
consideration of emotional state in role-playing agents. Specifically, we
design two kinds of retrieval strategies, i.e., combination strategy and
sequential strategy, to incorporate both memory semantic and emotional states

However, utilizing HTML presents new challenges. HTML contains additional

first-order logic rules, which are injected into LLMs to boost their reasoning
capabilities. Our method begins by formulating the search process relying on
LLMs' commonsense, where LLMs automatically define head and body predicates.
Then, RuAG applies Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to address the combinational
searching space and efficiently discover logic rules from data. The resulting
logic rules are translated into natural language, allowing targeted knowledge
injection and seamless integration into LLM prompts for LLM's downstream task
reasoning. We evaluate our framework on public and private industrial tasks,
including natural language processing, time-series, decision-making, and

  Combining Hierarchical Agents and RAG","The increasing use of smart devices has emphasized the critical role of
maintenance in production activities. Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals
(IETMs) are vital tools that support the maintenance of smart equipment.
However, traditional IETMs face challenges such as transitioning from Graphical
User Interfaces (GUIs) to natural Language User Interfaces (LUIs) and managing
complex logical relationships. Additionally, they must meet the current demands
for higher intelligence. This paper proposes a Maintenance Scheme Generation
Method based on Large Language Models (LLM-R). The proposed method includes
several key innovations: We propose the Low Rank Adaptation-Knowledge Retention
(LORA-KR) loss technology to proportionally adjust mixed maintenance data for
fine-tuning the LLM. This method prevents knowledge conflicts caused by mixed
data, improving the model's adaptability and reasoning ability in specific
maintenance domains, Besides, Hierarchical Task-Based Agent and
Instruction-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies are adopted
to optimize the generation steps and mitigate the phenomenon of hallucination
caused by the model's Inability to access contextual information. This
enhancement improves the model's flexibility and accuracy in handling known or
unknown maintenance objects and maintenance scheme scenarios. To validate the
proposed method's effectiveness in maintenance tasks, a maintenance scheme
dataset was constructed using objects from different fields. The experimental
results show that the accuracy of the maintenance schemes generated by the
proposed method reached 91.59%, indicating which improvement enhances the

text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that uses text extraction tools
such as optical character recognition (OCR). However, there are difficulties in
applying these methods in real-world scenarios: (a) questions often require

M3DocRAG, a novel multi-modal RAG framework that flexibly accommodates various
document contexts (closed-domain and open-domain), question hops (single-hop
and multi-hop), and evidence modalities (text, chart, figure, etc.). M3DocRAG
finds relevant documents and answers questions using a multi-modal retriever
and an MLM, so that it can efficiently handle single or many documents while
preserving visual information. Since previous DocVQA datasets ask questions in
the context of a specific document, we also present M3DocVQA, a new benchmark
for evaluating open-domain DocVQA over 3,000+ PDF documents with 40,000+ pages.
In three benchmarks (M3DocVQA/MMLongBench-Doc/MP-DocVQA), empirical results

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tackles this challenge and has shown a
significant impact on LLMs. Actually, we find that the impact of RAG on the

beneficial, neutral, and harmful. By minimizing retrieval requests that yield
neutral or harmful results, we can effectively reduce both time and
computational costs, while also improving the overall performance of LLMs. This

metrics as indicators, to decrease the retrieval ratio without compromising
performance. In our work, we propose a method that is able to identify
different types of questions from this view by training a Knowledge Boundary

illustrate that the KBM effectively delineates the knowledge boundary,
significantly decreasing the proportion of retrievals required for optimal

typical RAG implementation uses powerful retrieval models to extract external

recent LLM-based retrieval has gained attention for its substantial
improvements in information retrieval (IR) due to the LLMs' semantic
understanding capability. However, directly applying LLM to RAG systems
presents challenges. This may cause feature locality problems as massive
parametric knowledge can hinder effective usage of global information across
the corpus; for example, an LLM-based retriever often inputs document summaries
instead of full documents. Moreover, various pre-trained tasks in LLMs
introduce variance, further weakening performance as a retriever.
  To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning

is constructed by integrating LoRA-based representation learning to tackle
feature locality issues. To enhance retrieval performance, we develop two
patterns (invariant and variant patterns) and an invariance loss to reduce LLM
variance. In the generation stage, a refined fine-tuning method is employed to
improve LLM accuracy in generating answers based on retrieved information.

long-context LVLMs and employing GPT-based agents have emerged as promising
solutions. However, fine-tuning LVLMs would require extensive high-quality data
and substantial GPU resources, while GPT-based agents would rely on proprietary
models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this paper, we propose Video Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Video-RAG), a training-free and cost-effective pipeline that
employs visually-aligned auxiliary texts to help facilitate cross-modality
alignment while providing additional information beyond the visual content.
Specifically, we leverage open-source external tools to extract
visually-aligned information from pure video data (e.g., audio, optical
character, and object detection), and incorporate the extracted information
into an existing LVLM as auxiliary texts, alongside video frames and queries,
in a plug-and-play manner. Our Video-RAG offers several key advantages: (i)
lightweight with low computing overhead due to single-turn retrieval; (ii) easy
implementation and compatibility with any LVLM; and (iii) significant,
consistent performance gains across long video understanding benchmarks,
including Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench. Notably, our model demonstrates
superior performance over proprietary models like Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o

  Information Retrieval Systems","The rapid advancement of Language Model technologies has opened new
opportunities, but also introduced new challenges related to bias and fairness.
This paper explores the uncharted territory of potential biases in
state-of-the-art universal text embedding models towards specific document and
query writing styles within Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Our
investigation reveals that different embedding models exhibit different
preferences of document writing style, while more informal and emotive styles
are less favored by most embedding models. In terms of query writing styles,
many embedding models tend to match the style of the query with the style of
the retrieved documents, but some show a consistent preference for specific
styles. Text embedding models fine-tuned on synthetic data generated by LLMs
display a consistent preference for certain style of generated data. These
biases in text embedding based IR systems can inadvertently silence or
marginalize certain communication styles, thereby posing a significant threat
to fairness in information retrieval. Finally, we also compare the answer
styles of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on different LLMs
and find out that most text embedding models are biased towards LLM's answer
styles when used as evaluation metrics for answer correctness. This study sheds
light on the critical issue of writing style based bias in IR systems, offering
valuable insights for the development of more fair and robust models.",Hongliu Cao

RAG enriches the input to LLMs, enabling them to produce responses that are

To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Way-to-Specialist (WTS)

encompasses two closely coupled components: the DKG-Augmented LLM and the
LLM-Assisted DKG Evolution. The former retrieves question-relevant domain
knowledge from DKG and uses it to prompt LLM to enhance the reasoning
capability for domain-specific tasks; the latter leverages LLM to generate new
domain knowledge from processed tasks and use it to evolve DKG. WTS closes the

  Generation","Extracting relevant and structured knowledge from large, complex technical
documents within the Reliability and Maintainability (RAM) domain is
labor-intensive and prone to errors. Our work addresses this challenge by
presenting OntoKGen, a genuine pipeline for ontology extraction and Knowledge
Graph (KG) generation. OntoKGen leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) through
an interactive user interface guided by our adaptive iterative Chain of Thought
(CoT) algorithm to ensure that the ontology extraction process and, thus, KG
generation align with user-specific requirements. Although KG generation
follows a clear, structured path based on the confirmed ontology, there is no
universally correct ontology as it is inherently based on the user's
preferences. OntoKGen recommends an ontology grounded in best practices,
minimizing user effort and providing valuable insights that may have been
overlooked, all while giving the user complete control over the final ontology.
Having generated the KG based on the confirmed ontology, OntoKGen enables
seamless integration into schemeless, non-relational databases like Neo4j. This
integration allows for flexible storage and retrieval of knowledge from
diverse, unstructured sources, facilitating advanced querying, analysis, and

language models by retrieving relevant documents from credible literature and
integrating them into the context of the user query. Recently, the rise of the
cloud RAG service has made it possible for users to query relevant documents
conveniently. However, directly sending queries to the cloud brings potential
privacy leakage. In this paper, we are the first to formally define the
privacy-preserving cloud RAG service to protect the user query and propose
RemoteRAG as a solution regarding privacy, efficiency, and accuracy. For
privacy, we introduce $(n,\epsilon)$-DistanceDP to characterize privacy leakage
of the user query and the leakage inferred from relevant documents. For
efficiency, we limit the search range from the total documents to a small
number of selected documents related to a perturbed embedding generated from
$(n,\epsilon)$-DistanceDP, so that computation and communication costs required
for privacy protection significantly decrease. For accuracy, we ensure that the
small range includes target documents related to the user query with detailed
theoretical analysis. Experimental results also demonstrate that RemoteRAG can
resist existing embedding inversion attack methods while achieving no loss in
retrieval under various settings. Moreover, RemoteRAG is efficient, incurring
only $0.67$ seconds and $46.66$KB of data transmission ($2.72$ hours and $1.43$

The policy model can perform two actions: to fetch FAQ context or skip

including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers,
using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results. We
propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and
fine-Tuning pipeline. We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset.
Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a
potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific
insights to a farmer? Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset
generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the
quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. We see an
accuracy increase of over 6 p.p. when fine-tuning the model and this is
cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further. In one
particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages
information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing
answer similarity from 47% to 72%. Overall, the results point to how systems
built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a
dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further
applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.",Angels Balaguer

  Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models","Recent proprietary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have achieved
a milestone in tackling diverse challenges in the biomedical domain, ranging
from multiple-choice questions to long-form generations. To address challenges
that still cannot be handled with the encoded knowledge of LLMs, various
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been developed by searching
documents from the knowledge corpus and appending them unconditionally or
selectively to the input of LLMs for generation. However, when applying
existing methods to different domain-specific problems, poor generalization
becomes apparent, leading to fetching incorrect documents or making inaccurate
judgments. In this paper, we introduce Self-BioRAG, a framework reliable for
biomedical text that specializes in generating explanations, retrieving
domain-specific documents, and self-reflecting generated responses. We utilize
84k filtered biomedical instruction sets to train Self-BioRAG that can assess
its generated explanations with customized reflective tokens. Our work proves
that domain-specific components, such as a retriever, domain-related document
corpus, and instruction sets are necessary for adhering to domain-related
instructions. Using three major medical question-answering benchmark datasets,
experimental results of Self-BioRAG demonstrate significant performance gains
by achieving a 7.2% absolute improvement on average over the state-of-the-art
open-foundation model with a parameter size of 7B or less. Overall, we analyze
that Self-BioRAG finds the clues in the question, retrieves relevant documents
if needed, and understands how to answer with information from retrieved
documents and encoded knowledge as a medical expert does. We release our data

enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also
tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots'
responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs,
interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such
cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or
their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented

is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are
trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is

  Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of LLM-based CDSS in correctly
identifying medication errors in different patient case vignettes from diverse
medical and surgical sub-disciplines, against a human expert panel derived
ground truth. We compared performance for under 2 different CDSS practical
healthcare integration modalities: LLM-based CDSS alone (fully autonomous mode)

  Design, Setting, and Participants: Utilizing a RAG model with
state-of-the-art medically-related LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini Pro 1.0 and Med-PaLM 2),
this study used 61 prescribing error scenarios embedded into 23 complex
clinical vignettes across 12 different medical and surgical specialties. A
multidisciplinary expert panel assessed these cases for Drug-Related Problems
(DRPs) using the PCNE classification and graded severity / potential for harm

  AI-Native Wireless Systems","Large language models (LLMs) and foundation models have been recently touted
as a game-changer for 6G systems. However, recent efforts on LLMs for wireless
networks are limited to a direct application of existing language models that
were designed for natural language processing (NLP) applications. To address
this challenge and create wireless-centric foundation models, this paper
presents a comprehensive vision on how to design universal foundation models
that are tailored towards the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI)-native
networks. Diverging from NLP-based foundation models, the proposed framework
promotes the design of large multi-modal models (LMMs) fostered by three key
capabilities: 1) processing of multi-modal sensing data, 2) grounding of
physical symbol representations in real-world wireless systems using causal
reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and 3) enabling
instructibility from the wireless environment feedback to facilitate dynamic
network adaptation thanks to logical and mathematical reasoning facilitated by
neuro-symbolic AI. In essence, these properties enable the proposed LMM
framework to build universal capabilities that cater to various cross-layer
networking tasks and alignment of intents across different domains. Preliminary
results from experimental evaluation demonstrate the efficacy of grounding
using RAG in LMMs, and showcase the alignment of LMMs with wireless system
designs. Furthermore, the enhanced rationale exhibited in the responses to
mathematical questions by LMMs, compared to vanilla LLMs, demonstrates the
logical and mathematical reasoning capabilities inherent in LMMs. Building on
those results, we present a sequel of open questions and challenges for LMMs.

aimed to develop a reliable Caregiving Language Model (CaLM) by using FMs and a
caregiving knowledge base, develop an accessible CaLM using a small FM that
requires fewer computing resources, and evaluate the performance of the model

quality of FM answers by grounding the model on a caregiving knowledge base. We
used two small FMs as candidates for the FM of CaLM (LLaMA-2 and Falcon with 7B

knowledge base by gathering various types of documents from the Internet. In
this study, we focused on caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease

provide accurate references with the answers. The RAG framework improved the
performance of all FMs used in this study across all measures. As expected, the
large FM performed better than small FMs across all metrics. The most
interesting result is that small fine-tuned FMs with RAG performed
significantly better than GPT 3.5 across all metrics. The fine-tuned LLaMA-2

2024-03-21T13:05:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14374v1,FIT-RAG: Black-Box RAG with Factual Information and Token Reduction,"Due to the extraordinarily large number of parameters, fine-tuning Large
Language Models (LLMs) to update long-tail or out-of-date knowledge is
impractical in lots of applications. To avoid fine-tuning, we can alternatively
treat a LLM as a black-box (i.e., freeze the parameters of the LLM) and augment
it with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, namely black-box RAG.
Recently, black-box RAG has achieved success in knowledge-intensive tasks and
has gained much attention. Existing black-box RAG methods typically fine-tune
the retriever to cater to LLMs' preferences and concatenate all the retrieved
documents as the input, which suffers from two issues: (1) Ignorance of Factual
Information. The LLM preferred documents may not contain the factual
information for the given question, which can mislead the retriever and hurt
the effectiveness of black-box RAG; (2) Waste of Tokens. Simply concatenating
all the retrieved documents brings large amounts of unnecessary tokens for
LLMs, which degenerates the efficiency of black-box RAG. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a novel black-box RAG framework which utilizes the
factual information in the retrieval and reduces the number of tokens for
augmentation, dubbed FIT-RAG. FIT-RAG utilizes the factual information by
constructing a bi-label document scorer. Besides, it reduces the tokens by
introducing a self-knowledge recognizer and a sub-document-level token reducer.
FIT-RAG achieves both superior effectiveness and efficiency, which is validated
by extensive experiments across three open-domain question-answering datasets:
TriviaQA, NQ and PopQA. FIT-RAG can improve the answering accuracy of
Llama2-13B-Chat by 14.3\% on TriviaQA, 19.9\% on NQ and 27.5\% on PopQA,

Then, a system powered by large language models is designed and implemented to
process the ""semantic node"" and generate standardized digital twin models from
raw textual data collected from datasheets describing technical assets. Our
evaluation demonstrates an effective generation rate of 62-79%, indicating a
substantial proportion of the information from the source text can be

numerous benefits. However, hallucination is a significant concern. In
response, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a highly
promising paradigm to improve LLM outputs by grounding them in factual
information. RAG relies on textual entailment (TE) or similar methods to check
if the text produced by LLMs is supported or contradicted, compared to
retrieved documents. This paper argues that conventional TE methods are
inadequate for spotting hallucinations in content generated by LLMs. For
instance, consider a prompt about the 'USA's stance on the Ukraine war''. The
AI-generated text states, ...U.S. President Barack Obama says the U.S. will not
put troops in Ukraine...'' However, during the war the U.S. president is Joe
Biden which contradicts factual reality. Moreover, current TE systems are
unable to accurately annotate the given text and identify the exact portion
that is contradicted. To address this, we introduces a new type of TE called
``Factual Entailment (FE).'', aims to detect factual inaccuracies in content
generated by LLMs while also highlighting the specific text segment that
contradicts reality. We present FACTOID (FACTual enTAILment for hallucInation
Detection), a benchmark dataset for FE. We propose a multi-task learning (MTL)
framework for FE, incorporating state-of-the-art (SoTA) long text embeddings
such as e5-mistral-7b-instruct, along with GPT-3, SpanBERT, and RoFormer. The
proposed MTL architecture for FE achieves an avg. 40\% improvement in accuracy
on the FACTOID benchmark compared to SoTA TE methods. As FE automatically
detects hallucinations, we assessed 15 modern LLMs and ranked them using our
proposed Auto Hallucination Vulnerability Index (HVI_auto). This index
quantifies and offers a comparative scale to evaluate and rank LLMs according
to their hallucinations.",Vipula Rawte

  and external evidence","Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is frequently used to mitigate
hallucinations and provide up-to-date knowledge for large language models
(LLMs). However, given that document retrieval is an imprecise task and
sometimes results in erroneous or even harmful content being presented in
context, this raises the question of how LLMs handle retrieved information: If
the provided content is incorrect, does the model know to ignore it, or does it
recapitulate the error? Conversely, when the model's initial response is
incorrect, does it always know to use the retrieved information to correct
itself, or does it insist on its wrong prior response? To answer this, we
curate a dataset of over 1200 questions across six domains (e.g., drug dosages,
Olympic records, locations) along with content relevant to answering each
question. We further apply precise perturbations to the answers in the content
that range from subtle to blatant errors. We benchmark six top-performing LLMs,
including GPT-4o, on this dataset and find that LLMs are susceptible to
adopting incorrect retrieved content, overriding their own correct prior
knowledge over 60% of the time. However, the more unrealistic the retrieved
content is (i.e. more deviated from truth), the less likely the model is to
adopt it. Also, the less confident a model is in its initial response (via
measuring token probabilities), the more likely it is to adopt the information
in the retrieved content. We exploit this finding and demonstrate simple
methods for improving model accuracy where there is conflicting retrieved
content. Our results highlight a difficult task and benchmark for LLMs --
namely, their ability to correctly discern when it is wrong in light of correct
retrieved content and to reject cases when the provided content is incorrect.",Kevin Wu

language generation and information retrieval to power many real-world
applications like chatbots. Use of RAG for understanding of videos is appealing
but there are two critical limitations. One-time, upfront conversion of all
content in large corpus of videos into text descriptions entails high
processing times. Also, not all information in the rich video data is typically
captured in the text descriptions. Since user queries are not known apriori,
developing a system for video to text conversion and interactive querying of
video data is challenging.
  To address these limitations, we propose an incremental RAG system called
iRAG, which augments RAG with a novel incremental workflow to enable
interactive querying of a large corpus of videos. Unlike traditional RAG, iRAG
quickly indexes large repositories of videos, and in the incremental workflow,
it uses the index to opportunistically extract more details from select
portions of the videos to retrieve context relevant to an interactive user
query. Such an incremental workflow avoids long video to text conversion times,
and overcomes information loss issues due to conversion of video to text, by
doing on-demand query-specific extraction of details in video data. This
ensures high quality of responses to interactive user queries that are often
not known apriori. To the best of our knowledge, iRAG is the first system to
augment RAG with an incremental workflow to support efficient interactive
querying of a large corpus of videos. Experimental results on real-world
datasets demonstrate 23x to 25x faster video to text ingestion, while ensuring
that latency and quality of responses to interactive user queries is comparable
to responses from a traditional RAG where all video data is converted to text
upfront before any user querying.",Md Adnan Arefeen

Recent works have introduced retrieval-augmentation in the CoT reasoning to
solve multi-hop question answering. However, these chain methods have the

reasoning; 2) An error in the chain structure may lead to a cascade of errors.
  In this paper, we propose a dynamic retrieval framework called Tree of

paragraphs from retrieval, extending different reasoning paths from the root
node to other nodes. Our framework dynamically decides to initiate a new
search, reject, or accept based on the paragraphs on the reasoning paths.
Compared to related work, we introduce a tree structure to handle each
retrieved paragraph separately, alleviating the misleading effect of irrelevant
paragraphs on the reasoning path; the diversity of reasoning path extension
reduces the impact of a single reasoning error on the whole. We conducted
experiments on three different multi-hop question answering datasets. The
results show that compared to the baseline methods, ToR achieves

development of foundational deep learning models. The development of Large
Language Models (LLM) has evolved as a transformative paradigm in
conversational tasks, which has led to its integration and extension even in
the critical domain of healthcare. With LLMs becoming widely popular and their
public access through open-source models and integration with other
applications, there is a need to investigate their potential and limitations.
One such crucial task where LLMs are applied but require a deeper understanding
is that of self-diagnosis of medical conditions based on bias-validating
symptoms in the interest of public health. The widespread integration of Gemini
with Google search and GPT-4.0 with Bing search has led to a shift in the trend
of self-diagnosis using search engines to conversational LLM models. Owing to
the critical nature of the task, it is prudent to investigate and understand
the potential and limitations of public LLMs in the task of self-diagnosis. In
this study, we prepare a prompt engineered dataset of 10000 samples and test
the performance on the general task of self-diagnosis. We compared the
performance of both the state-of-the-art GPT-4.0 and the fee Gemini model on
the task of self-diagnosis and recorded contrasting accuracies of 63.07% and
6.01%, respectively. We also discuss the challenges, limitations, and potential
of both Gemini and GPT-4.0 for the task of self-diagnosis to facilitate future
research and towards the broader impact of general public knowledge.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential and improvement in performance for
the task of self-diagnosis using Retrieval Augmented Generation.",Nikil Sharan Prabahar Balasubramanian

  Vision-Language Models by Searching Up-to-Date Internet Knowledge","Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are ignorant of the up-to-date
knowledge, such as LLaVA series, because they cannot be updated frequently due
to the large amount of resources required, and therefore fail in many cases.
For example, if a LVLM was released on January 2024, and it wouldn't know the
singer of the theme song for the new Detective Conan movie, which wasn't
released until April 2024. To solve the problem, a promising solution motivated
by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is to provide LVLMs with up-to-date
knowledge via internet search during inference, i.e., internet-augmented
generation (IAG), which is already integrated in some closed-source commercial
LVLMs such as GPT-4V. However, the specific mechanics underpinning them remain
a mystery. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework, for augmenting
existing LVLMs in handling visual question answering (VQA) about up-to-date
knowledge, dubbed SearchLVLMs. A hierarchical filtering model is trained to
effectively and efficiently find the most helpful content from the websites
returned by a search engine to prompt LVLMs with up-to-date knowledge. To train
the model and evaluate our framework's performance, we propose a pipeline to
automatically generate news-related VQA samples to construct a dataset, dubbed
UDK-VQA. A multi-model voting mechanism is introduced to label the usefulness
of website/content for VQA samples to construct the training set. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, outperforming GPT-4V by
about 25% in accuracy.",Chuanhao Li

  Citation Bias","Citation practices are crucial in shaping the structure of scientific
knowledge, yet they are often influenced by contemporary norms and biases. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) introduces a new dynamic to these
practices. Interestingly, the characteristics and potential biases of
references recommended by LLMs that entirely rely on their parametric
knowledge, and not on search or retrieval-augmented generation, remain
unexplored. Here, we analyze these characteristics in an experiment using a
dataset from AAAI, NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR, published after GPT-4's knowledge
cut-off date. In our experiment, LLMs are tasked with suggesting scholarly
references for the anonymized in-text citations within these papers. Our
findings reveal a remarkable similarity between human and LLM citation
patterns, but with a more pronounced high citation bias, which persists even
after controlling for publication year, title length, number of authors, and
venue. The results hold for both GPT-4, and the more capable models GPT-4o and
Claude 3.5 where the papers are part of the training data. Additionally, we
observe a large consistency between the characteristics of LLM's existing and
non-existent generated references, indicating the model's internalization of
citation patterns. By analyzing citation graphs, we show that the references
recommended are embedded in the relevant citation context, suggesting an even
deeper conceptual internalization of the citation networks. While LLMs can aid
in citation generation, they may also amplify existing biases, such as the
Matthew effect, and introduce new ones, potentially skewing scientific
knowledge dissemination.",Andres Algaba

guaranteeing ""hallucination-free"" legal citations (LexisNexis, 2023). Because
of the closed nature of these systems, systematically assessing these claims is
challenging. In this article, we design and report on the first preregistered
empirical evaluation of AI-driven legal research tools. We demonstrate that the
providers' claims are overstated. While hallucinations are reduced relative to
general-purpose chatbots (GPT-4), we find that the AI research tools made by
LexisNexis (Lexis+ AI) and Thomson Reuters (Westlaw AI-Assisted Research and
Ask Practical Law AI) each hallucinate between 17% and 33% of the time. We also
document substantial differences between systems in responsiveness and
accuracy. Our article makes four key contributions. It is the first to assess
and report the performance of RAG-based proprietary legal AI tools. Second, it
introduces a comprehensive, preregistered dataset for identifying and
understanding vulnerabilities in these systems. Third, it proposes a clear
typology for differentiating between hallucinations and accurate legal

diverse and dynamic nature of real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks. To
bridge this gap, we introduce the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual
question answering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to
simulate web and Knowledge Graph (KG) search. CRAG is designed to encapsulate a
diverse array of questions across five domains and eight question categories,
reflecting varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal
dynamisms ranging from years to seconds. Our evaluation of this benchmark
highlights the gap to fully trustworthy QA. Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve
<=34% accuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the
accuracy only to 44%. State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions only answer 63%
of questions without any hallucination. CRAG also reveals much lower accuracy
in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity,
or higher complexity, suggesting future research directions. The CRAG benchmark
laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge and attracted thousands of
participants and submissions. We commit to maintaining CRAG to serve research

lack experienced doctors. Advances in large models and AI technologies offer
potential assistance. This work aims to address limitations in liver cancer
diagnosis models, such as poor understanding of medical images, insufficient
consideration of liver blood vessels, and ensuring accurate medical
information. We propose a specialized diagnostic assistant to improve the
diagnostic capabilities of less experienced doctors. Our framework combines
large and small models, using optimized small models for precise patient image
perception. Specifically, a segmentation network iteratively removes ambiguous
pixels for liver tumor segmentation, and a multi-scale, multi-level
differential network segments liver vessels. Features from these segmentations
and medical records form a patient's personalized knowledge base. For
diagnosis, Chain of Thought (COT) technology designs prompts mimicking
experienced doctors' thought patterns, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
technology provides answers based on reliable domain knowledge and trusted
cases. Our small model methods improve liver tumor and vessel segmentation
performance, resulting in more accurate information extraction. The large model
component scores over 1 point higher on a 10-point scale in evaluations by
doctors compared to control methods. Our method enhances semantic perception of
medical images, improves classification of ambiguous pixels, and optimizes
small object perception. It considers blood vessel positions for specific

artificial general intelligence (AGI). One opinion, especially from some
startups working on LLMs, argues that an LLM with nearly unlimited context
length can realize AGI. However, they might be too optimistic about the
long-context capability of (existing) LLMs -- (1) Recent literature has shown
that their effective context length is significantly smaller than their claimed
context length; and (2) Our reasoning-in-a-haystack experiments further
demonstrate that simultaneously finding the relevant information from a long
context and conducting (simple) reasoning is nearly impossible. In this paper,
we envision a pathway from LLMs to AGI through the integration of
\emph{memory}. We believe that AGI should be a system where LLMs serve as core
processors. In addition to raw data, the memory in this system would store a
large number of important conclusions derived from reasoning processes.
Compared with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that merely processing raw
data, this approach not only connects semantically related information closer,
but also simplifies complex inferences at the time of querying. As an
intermediate stage, the memory will likely be in the form of natural language
descriptions, which can be directly consumed by users too. Ultimately, every
agent/person should have its own large personal model, a deep neural network
model (thus \emph{AI-native}) that parameterizes and compresses all types of
memory, even the ones cannot be described by natural languages. Finally, we
discuss the significant potential of AI-native memory as the transformative
infrastructure for (proactive) engagement, personalization, distribution, and
social in the AGI era, as well as the incurred privacy and security challenges

systems, people either rely on direct Question-Answering (QA) to the LLM
itself, or in a biomedical experimental manner. How to precisely benchmark
biomedical agents from an AI Scientist perspective remains largely unexplored.
To this end, we draw inspiration from one most important abilities of
scientists, understanding the literature, and introduce BioKGBench. In contrast
to traditional evaluation benchmark that only focuses on factual QA, where the
LLMs are known to have hallucination issues, we first disentangle
""Understanding Literature"" into two atomic abilities, i) ""Understanding"" the
unstructured text from research papers by performing scientific claim
verification, and ii) Ability to interact with structured Knowledge-Graph
Question-Answering (KGQA) as a form of ""Literature"" grounding. We then

design of an LLM-driven CRS in an SME setting, and its subsequent performance
in the field using both objective system metrics and subjective user

providing questions without any context, as well as assess how LLMs synthesize
the contextual information present in long NEPA documents to facilitate the

of this project is to build a chatbot architecture, called SlicerChat, that is
optimized to answer 3D Slicer related questions and able to run locally using
an open-source model. The core research questions explored in this work revolve
around the answer quality and speed differences due to fine-tuning, model size,

system was built as a custom extension in 3D Slicer based on the Code-Llama
Instruct architecture. Models of size 1.1B, 7B and 13B were fine-tuned using
Low rank Adaptation, and various sources of 3D Slicer documentation were
compiled for use in a Retrieval Augmented Generation paradigm. Testing
combinations of fine-tuning and model sizes on a benchmark dataset of five 3D
Slicer questions revealed that fine-tuning had no impact on model performance
or speed compared to the base architecture, and that larger models performed
better with a significant speed decrease. Experiments with adding 3D Slicer

leveraging external knowledge databases. Numerous studies have demonstrated the
effectiveness of RAG to more successfully accomplish downstream tasks when
using vector datasets that consist of relevant background information. It has
been implicitly assumed by those in the field that if adversarial background
information is utilized in this context, that the success of using a RAG-based

Recently, large language models (LLM) based log parsers have shown superior
parsing accuracy. However, existing LLM-based parsers face three main
challenges: 1)time-consuming and labor-intensive manual labeling for
fine-tuning or in-context learning, 2)increased parsing costs due to the vast

overcome these limitations, this paper introduces LibreLog, an unsupervised log
parsing approach that leverages open-source LLMs (i.e., Llama3-8B) to enhance
privacy and reduce operational costs while achieving state-of-the-art parsing
accuracy. LibreLog first groups logs with similar static text but varying
dynamic variables using a fixed-depth grouping tree. It then parses logs within
these groups using three components: i)similarity scoring-based retrieval
augmented generation: selects diverse logs within each group based on Jaccard
similarity, helping the LLM distinguish between static text and dynamic
variables; ii)self-reflection: iteratively query LLMs to refine log templates
to improve parsing accuracy; and iii) log template memory: stores parsed
templates to reduce LLM queries for improved parsing efficiency. Our evaluation
on LogHub-2.0 shows that LibreLog achieves 25% higher parsing accuracy and
processes logs 2.7 times faster compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based parsers.

the ReDis-QA dataset, we benchmarked several open-source LLMs, revealing that
diagnosing rare diseases remains a significant challenge for these models.
  To facilitate retrieval augmentation generation for rare disease diagnosis,
we collect the first rare diseases corpus (ReCOP), sourced from the National
Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) database. Specifically, we split the
report of each rare disease into multiple chunks, each representing a different
property of the disease, including their overview, symptoms, causes, effects,
related disorders, diagnosis, and standard therapies. This structure ensures
that the information within each chunk aligns consistently with a question.
Experiment results demonstrate that ReCOP can effectively improve the accuracy
of LLMs on the ReDis-QA dataset by an average of 8%. Moreover, it significantly
guides LLMs to generate trustworthy answers and explanations that can be traced
back to existing literature.",Guanchu Wang

diverse arguments and evidence. However, creating commentary is a
time-consuming task, even for skilled commentators. Large language models
(LLMs) have simplified the process of natural language generation, but their
direct application in commentary creation still faces challenges due to unique
task requirements. These requirements can be categorized into two levels: 1)
fundamental requirements, which include creating well-structured and logically
consistent narratives, and 2) advanced requirements, which involve generating
quality arguments and providing convincing evidence. In this paper, we
introduce Xinyu, an efficient LLM-based system designed to assist commentators
in generating Chinese commentaries. To meet the fundamental requirements, we
deconstruct the generation process into sequential steps, proposing targeted
strategies and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for each step. To address the
advanced requirements, we present an argument ranking model for arguments and
establish a comprehensive evidence database that includes up-to-date events and
classic books, thereby strengthening the substantiation of the evidence with
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology. To evaluate the generated
commentaries more fairly, corresponding to the two-level requirements, we
introduce a comprehensive evaluation metric that considers five distinct
perspectives in commentary generation. Our experiments confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed system. We also observe a significant increase in
the efficiency of commentators in real-world scenarios, with the average time
spent on creating a commentary dropping from 4 hours to 20 minutes.
Importantly, such an increase in efficiency does not compromise the quality of
the commentaries.",Yiquan Wu

leading to efforts to fine-tune them on domain-specific data. However, the
effectiveness of this approach remains unclear. This study evaluates the
performance of biomedically fine-tuned LLMs against their general-purpose
counterparts on a variety of clinical tasks. We evaluated their performance on
clinical case challenges from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and
the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and on several clinical
tasks (e.g., information extraction, document summarization, and clinical
coding). Using benchmarks specifically chosen to be likely outside the
fine-tuning datasets of biomedical models, we found that biomedical LLMs mostly
perform inferior to their general-purpose counterparts, especially on tasks not
focused on medical knowledge. While larger models showed similar performance on
case tasks (e.g., OpenBioLLM-70B: 66.4% vs. Llama-3-70B-Instruct: 65% on JAMA
cases), smaller biomedical models showed more pronounced underperformance
(e.g., OpenBioLLM-8B: 30% vs. Llama-3-8B-Instruct: 64.3% on NEJM cases).
Similar trends were observed across the CLUE (Clinical Language Understanding
Evaluation) benchmark tasks, with general-purpose models often performing
better on text generation, question answering, and coding tasks. Our results
suggest that fine-tuning LLMs to biomedical data may not provide the expected
benefits and may potentially lead to reduced performance, challenging
prevailing assumptions about domain-specific adaptation of LLMs and
highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation frameworks in healthcare AI.
Alternative approaches, such as retrieval-augmented generation, may be more
effective in enhancing the biomedical capabilities of LLMs without compromising
their general knowledge.",Felix J. Dorfner

powerful tools for code generation, significantly enhancing productivity and
accelerating software development. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus
on general code generation without considering API-oriented code generation,
i.e., generating code that invokes APIs from specific libraries. Given the
growing demand for API-oriented code generation, there is a pressing need for a
systematic and automated approach to evaluate LLM on API-oriented code
generation. To address this gap, we propose AutoAPIEval, a lightweight and
automated framework designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in

provides API documentation and focuses on two unit tasks: API recommendation
and code example generation, along with four metrics to evaluate the generated
APIs and code examples, such as the proportion of incorrect API recommendations
for Task 1, and the proportion of code examples where no specific API is
invoked and uncompilable/unexecutable code examples for Task 2. In addition, we
conducted a case study on three LLMs (ChatGPT, MagiCoder, and DeepSeek Coder)

Our findings reveal substantial variability in LLM performance across tasks,
with ChatGPT adhering better to instructions, while sharing similar
effectiveness in code example generation with its counterparts (i.e., MagiCoder

life and have cemented their continued usefulness in this new era of generative
AI via retrieval-augmented generation. With strong language processing
capabilities and remarkable versatility, large language models (LLMs) have
become popular choices for zero-shot re-ranking in IR systems. So far,
LLM-based re-ranking methods rely on strong generative capabilities, which
restricts their use to either specialized or powerful proprietary models. Given
these restrictions, we ask: is autoregressive generation necessary and optimal
for LLMs to perform re-ranking? We hypothesize that there are abundant signals
relevant to re-ranking within LLMs that might not be used to their full
potential via generation. To more directly leverage such signals, we propose
in-context re-ranking (ICR), a novel method that leverages the change in
attention pattern caused by the search query for accurate and efficient
re-ranking. To mitigate the intrinsic biases in LLMs, we propose a calibration
method using a content-free query. Due to the absence of generation, ICR only
requires two ($O(1)$) forward passes to re-rank $N$ documents, making it
substantially more efficient than generative re-ranking methods that require at
least $O(N)$ forward passes. Our novel design also enables ICR to be applied to
any LLM without specialized training while guaranteeing a well-formed ranking.
Extensive experiments with two popular open-weight LLMs on standard single-hop
and multi-hop information retrieval benchmarks show that ICR outperforms
RankGPT while cutting the latency by more than 60% in practice. Through
detailed analyses, we show that ICR's performance is specially strong on tasks

To establish validity of the method, we present three case studies applying the

Specifically, we investigate the extent to which a workflow comprising
open-source models and tools can inductively produce codebooks that approach

traditional thematic analysis by reading text one unit of analysis at a time,
considering existing codes already in the codebook, and then deciding whether
or not to generate a new code based on whether the extant codebook provides
adequate thematic coverage. We demonstrate this workflow using three synthetic
datasets from hypothetical organizational research settings: a study of

on its context vs. its prior knowledge. Choosing how sensitive the model is to
its context is a fundamental functionality, as it enables the model to excel at
tasks like retrieval-augmented generation and question-answering. In this
paper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining
whether language models answer from the context or their prior knowledge. To
guide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In
this task, we first feed the model a context (Paris is in England) and a
question (Where is Paris?); we then instruct the model to either use its prior
or contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer
for both intents (either France or England). When fine-tuned on this task,
instruction-tuned versions of Llama-3.1, Mistral-v0.3, and Gemma-2 can solve it
with high accuracy (85-95%). Analyzing these high-performing models, we narrow
down which layers may be important to context sensitivity using a novel linear
time algorithm. Then, in each model, we identify a 1-D subspace in a single
layer that encodes whether the model follows context or prior knowledge.
Interestingly, while we identify this subspace in a fine-tuned model, we find
that the exact same subspace serves as an effective knob in not only that model
but also non-fine-tuned instruct and base models of that model family. Finally,
we show a strong correlation between a model's performance and how distinctly
it separates context-agreeing from context-ignoring answers in this subspace.
These results suggest a single subspace facilitates how the model chooses

mitigates the need for learning cross-modal mapping, which poses difficulty in
image-to-text generation, by casting the cross-modal mapping problem as an
in-domain retrieval of similar DWI images that have paired ground-truth text
radiology reports. By exploiting the retrieved radiology reports to augment the
report generation process of the query image, we show by experiments with
extensive in-house and public datasets that PIRTA can accurately retrieve
relevant reports from 3D DWI images. This approach enables the generation of
radiology reports with significantly higher accuracy compared to direct
image-to-text generation using state-of-the-art multimodal language models.",Junhyeok Lee

dedicated to content creation. Weaver is pre-trained on a carefully selected
corpus that focuses on improving the writing capabilities of large language
models. We then fine-tune Weaver for creative and professional writing purposes
and align it to the preference of professional writers using a suit of novel
methods for instruction data synthesis and LLM alignment, making it able to
produce more human-like texts and follow more diverse instructions for content
creation. The Weaver family consists of models of Weaver Mini (1.8B), Weaver
Base (6B), Weaver Pro (14B), and Weaver Ultra (34B) sizes, suitable for
different applications and can be dynamically dispatched by a routing agent
according to query complexity to balance response quality and computation cost.
Evaluation on a carefully curated benchmark for assessing the writing
capabilities of LLMs shows Weaver models of all sizes outperform generalist
LLMs several times larger than them. Notably, our most-capable Weaver Ultra
model surpasses GPT-4, a state-of-the-art generalist LLM, on various writing
scenarios, demonstrating the advantage of training specialized LLMs for writing
purposes. Moreover, Weaver natively supports retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and function calling (tool usage). We present various use cases of these
abilities for improving AI-assisted writing systems, including integration of
external knowledge bases, tools, or APIs, and providing personalized writing
assistance. Furthermore, we discuss and summarize a guideline and best
practices for pre-training and fine-tuning domain-specific LLMs.",Tiannan Wang

  systems","Evidence to guide healthcare decisions is often limited by a lack of relevant
and trustworthy literature as well as difficulty in contextualizing existing
research for a specific patient. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially
address both challenges by either summarizing published literature or
generating new studies based on real-world data (RWD). We evaluated the ability
of five LLM-based systems in answering 50 clinical questions and had nine
independent physicians review the responses for relevance, reliability, and
actionability. As it stands, general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT-4, Claude 3 Opus,
Gemini Pro 1.5) rarely produced answers that were deemed relevant and
evidence-based (2% - 10%). In contrast, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG)-based and agentic LLM systems produced relevant and evidence-based
answers for 24% (OpenEvidence) to 58% (ChatRWD) of questions. Only the agentic
ChatRWD was able to answer novel questions compared to other LLMs (65% vs.
0-9%). These results suggest that while general-purpose LLMs should not be used
as-is, a purpose-built system for evidence summarization based on RAG and one
for generating novel evidence working synergistically would improve
availability of pertinent evidence for patient care.",Yen Sia Low
