  Frameworks","Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has markedly enhanced the capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. The
increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG,
leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary
technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems.
However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm,
with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of
""retrieve-then-generate"". In this context, this paper examines the limitations
of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By
decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized
operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG
transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced
design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on
extensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG
patterns-linear, conditional, branching, and looping-and offers a comprehensive
analysis of their respective implementation nuances. Modular RAG presents
innovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of RAG
systems. Finally, the paper explores the potential emergence of new operators
and paradigms, establishing a solid theoretical foundation and a practical
roadmap for the continued evolution and practical deployment of RAG
technologies.",Yunfan Gao

retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been a reliable solution for
context-based answer generation in the past. Recently, the emergence of
long-context LLMs allows the models to incorporate much longer text sequences,
making RAG less attractive. Recent studies show that long-context LLMs
significantly outperform RAG in long-context applications. Unlike the existing
works favoring the long-context LLM over RAG, we argue that the extremely long
context in LLMs suffers from a diminished focus on relevant information and
leads to potential degradation in answer quality. This paper revisits the RAG
in long-context answer generation. We propose an order-preserve
retrieval-augmented generation (OP-RAG) mechanism, which significantly improves
the performance of RAG for long-context question-answer applications. With
OP-RAG, as the number of retrieved chunks increases, the answer quality
initially rises, and then declines, forming an inverted U-shaped curve. There
exist sweet points where OP-RAG could achieve higher answer quality with much
less tokens than long-context LLM taking the whole context as input. Extensive
experiments on public benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our OP-RAG.",Tan Yu

  Update","Large Language Models are revolutionizing Web, mobile, and Web of Things
systems, driving intelligent and scalable solutions. However, as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems expand, they encounter significant
challenges related to scalability, including increased delay and communication
overhead. To address these issues, we propose EACO-RAG, an edge-assisted
distributed RAG system that leverages adaptive knowledge updates and inter-node
collaboration. By distributing vector datasets across edge nodes and optimizing
retrieval processes, EACO-RAG significantly reduces delay and resource
consumption while enhancing response accuracy. The system employs a multi-armed
bandit framework with safe online Bayesian methods to balance performance and
cost. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that EACO-RAG outperforms
traditional centralized RAG systems in both response time and resource
efficiency. EACO-RAG effectively reduces delay and resource expenditure to
levels comparable to, or even lower than, those of local RAG systems, while
significantly improving accuracy. This study presents the first systematic
exploration of edge-assisted distributed RAG architectures, providing a
scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale distributed environments.",Jiaxing Li

  Queries","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) augments large language models (LLM) by
retrieving relevant knowledge, showing promising potential in mitigating LLM
hallucinations and enhancing response quality, thereby facilitating the great
adoption of LLMs in practice. However, we find that existing RAG systems are
inadequate in answering multi-hop queries, which require retrieving and
reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence. Furthermore, to our
knowledge, no existing RAG benchmarking dataset focuses on multi-hop queries.
In this paper, we develop a novel dataset, MultiHop-RAG, which consists of a
knowledge base, a large collection of multi-hop queries, their ground-truth
answers, and the associated supporting evidence. We detail the procedure of
building the dataset, utilizing an English news article dataset as the
underlying RAG knowledge base. We demonstrate the benchmarking utility of
MultiHop-RAG in two experiments. The first experiment compares different
embedding models for retrieving evidence for multi-hop queries. In the second
experiment, we examine the capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs,
including GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama2-70B, in reasoning and answering multi-hop
queries given the evidence. Both experiments reveal that existing RAG methods
perform unsatisfactorily in retrieving and answering multi-hop queries. We hope
MultiHop-RAG will be a valuable resource for the community in developing
effective RAG systems, thereby facilitating greater adoption of LLMs in
practice. The MultiHop-RAG and implemented RAG system is publicly available at

  Conflicts for Large Language Models","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while effective in integrating external
knowledge to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be
undermined by imperfect retrieval, which may introduce irrelevant, misleading,
or even malicious information. Despite its importance, previous studies have
rarely explored the behavior of RAG through joint analysis on how errors from
imperfect retrieval attribute and propagate, and how potential conflicts arise
between the LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. We find that
imperfect retrieval augmentation might be inevitable and quite harmful, through
controlled analysis under realistic conditions. We identify the knowledge
conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a
bottleneck to overcome in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To render LLMs
resilient to imperfect retrieval, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach
that adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge,
iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness,
and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments
using Gemini and Claude demonstrate that Astute RAG significantly outperforms
previous robustness-enhanced RAG methods. Notably, Astute RAG is the only
approach that matches or exceeds the performance of LLMs without RAG under
worst-case scenarios. Further analysis reveals that Astute RAG effectively
resolves knowledge conflicts, improving the reliability and trustworthiness of
RAG systems.",Fei Wang

  System","Software engineers are increasingly adding semantic search capabilities to
applications using a strategy known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). A
RAG system involves finding documents that semantically match a query and then
passing the documents to a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to
extract the right answer using an LLM. RAG systems aim to: a) reduce the
problem of hallucinated responses from LLMs, b) link sources/references to
generated responses, and c) remove the need for annotating documents with
meta-data. However, RAG systems suffer from limitations inherent to information
retrieval systems and from reliance on LLMs. In this paper, we present an
experience report on the failure points of RAG systems from three case studies
from separate domains: research, education, and biomedical. We share the
lessons learned and present 7 failure points to consider when designing a RAG
system. The two key takeaways arising from our work are: 1) validation of a RAG
system is only feasible during operation, and 2) the robustness of a RAG system
evolves rather than designed in at the start. We conclude with a list of
potential research directions on RAG systems for the software engineering
community.",Scott Barnett

owners regarding unauthorized use of their content in RAG systems. Despite its
importance, the challenge of detecting such unauthorized usage remains
underexplored, with existing datasets and methodologies from adjacent fields
being ill-suited for its study. In this work, we take several steps to bridge
this gap. First, we formalize this problem as (black-box) RAG Dataset Inference
(RAG-DI). To facilitate research on this challenge, we further introduce a
novel dataset specifically designed for benchmarking RAG-DI methods under
realistic conditions, and propose a set of baseline approaches. Building on
this foundation, we introduce Ward, a RAG-DI method based on LLM watermarks
that enables data owners to obtain rigorous statistical guarantees regarding
the usage of their dataset in a RAG system. In our experimental evaluation, we

generate better responses with external knowledge, but using more external

Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG

workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and

that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each

generates a response based on the provided query and context. However,
comprehensive evaluation of RAG systems remains a challenge due to the lack of
unified evaluation criteria and annotated datasets. In response, we introduce
RAGBench: the first comprehensive, large-scale RAG benchmark dataset of 100k
examples. It covers five unique industry-specific domains and various RAG task
types. RAGBench examples are sourced from industry corpora such as user
manuals, making it particularly relevant for industry applications. Further, we
formalize the TRACe evaluation framework: a set of explainable and actionable
RAG evaluation metrics applicable across all RAG domains. We release the
labeled dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rungalileo/ragbench.
RAGBench explainable labels facilitate holistic evaluation of RAG systems,
enabling actionable feedback for continuous improvement of production
applications. Thorough extensive benchmarking, we find that LLM-based RAG

leading to the widespread adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems. However, despite retrieval being a core component of RAG, much of the
research in this area overlooks the extensive body of work on fair ranking,
neglecting the importance of considering all stakeholders involved. This paper
presents the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems integrated with fair

item across the rankings utilized by RAG systems (i.e., item-side fairness),
aiming to promote equitable growth for relevant item providers. To gain a deep
understanding of the relationship between item-fairness, ranking quality, and
generation quality in the context of RAG, we analyze nine different RAG systems
that incorporate fair rankings across seven distinct datasets. Our findings
indicate that RAG systems with fair rankings can maintain a high level of
generation quality and, in many cases, even outperform traditional RAG systems,
despite the general trend of a tradeoff between ensuring fairness and
maintaining system-effectiveness. We believe our insights lay the groundwork
for responsible and equitable RAG systems and open new avenues for future

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Despite recent advancements in
Large Language Models (LLMs), research on assessing and improving

address this issue, we propose VIF-RAG, the first automated, scalable, and
verifiable synthetic pipeline for instruction-following alignment in RAG
systems. We start by manually crafting a minimal set of atomic instructions

instructions for a seed set. We then use supervised models for instruction
rewriting while simultaneously generating code to automate the verification of
instruction quality via a Python executor. Finally, we integrate these
instructions with extensive RAG and general data samples, scaling up to a
high-quality VIF-RAG-QA dataset (>100k) through automated processes. To further
bridge the gap in instruction-following auto-evaluation for RAG systems, we
introduce FollowRAG Benchmark, which includes approximately 3K test samples,
covering 22 categories of general instruction constraints and four

  Data Rewards","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven its effectiveness in
mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving
knowledge from external resources. To adapt LLMs for RAG pipelines, current
approaches use instruction tuning to optimize LLMs, improving their ability to
utilize retrieved knowledge. This supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach focuses
on equipping LLMs to handle diverse RAG tasks using different instructions.
However, it trains RAG modules to overfit training signals and overlooks the
varying data preferences among agents within the RAG system. In this paper, we
propose a Differentiable Data Rewards (DDR) method, which end-to-end trains RAG
systems by aligning data preferences between different RAG modules. DDR works
by collecting the rewards to optimize each agent with a rollout method. This
method prompts agents to sample some potential responses as perturbations,
evaluates the impact of these perturbations on the whole RAG system, and
subsequently optimizes the agent to produce outputs that improve the
performance of the RAG system. Our experiments on various knowledge-intensive
tasks demonstrate that DDR significantly outperforms the SFT method,
particularly for LLMs with smaller-scale parameters that depend more on the
retrieved knowledge. Additionally, DDR exhibits a stronger capability to align
the data preference between RAG modules. The DDR method makes generation module
more effective in extracting key information from documents and mitigating

issues of outdated and hallucinatory content in the generation of large

general-purpose LLM serves as the RAG generator, it often suffers from
inadequate response informativeness, response robustness, and citation quality.
Past approaches to tackle these limitations, either by incorporating additional
steps beyond generating responses or optimizing the generator through
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), still failed to align with the RAG requirement
thoroughly. Consequently, optimizing the RAG generator from multiple preference
perspectives while maintaining its end-to-end LLM form remains a challenge. To
bridge this gap, we propose Multiple Perspective Preference Alignment for
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PA-RAG), a method for optimizing the generator
of RAG systems to align with RAG requirements comprehensively. Specifically, we
construct high-quality instruction fine-tuning data and multi-perspective
preference data by sampling varied quality responses from the generator across
different prompt documents quality scenarios. Subsequently, we optimize the
generator using SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive

large language models (LLMs). Studies show that while RAG provides valuable
external information (benefit), it may also mislead LLMs (detriment) with noisy
or incorrect retrieved texts. Although many existing methods attempt to
preserve benefit and avoid detriment, they lack a theoretical explanation for
RAG. The benefit and detriment in the next token prediction of RAG remain a
black box that cannot be quantified or compared in an explainable manner, so
existing methods are data-driven, need additional utility evaluators or
post-hoc. This paper takes the first step towards providing a theory to explain
and trade off the benefit and detriment in RAG. First, we model RAG as the
fusion between distribution of LLMs knowledge and distribution of retrieved
texts. Then, we formalize the trade-off between the value of external knowledge
(benefit) and its potential risk of misleading LLMs (detriment) in next token
prediction of RAG by distribution difference in this fusion. Finally, we prove
that the actual effect of RAG on the token, which is the comparison between
benefit and detriment, can be predicted without any training or accessing the
utility of retrieval. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel method,
Tok-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between the pure LLM and RAG
at token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments in
real-world tasks using LLMs such as OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the
effectiveness of our method and support our theoretical findings.",Shicheng Xu

Existing benchmarks, such as LegalBench, assess the generative capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs) in the legal domain, but there is a critical gap
in evaluating the retrieval component of RAG systems. To address this, we
introduce LegalBench-RAG, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
the retrieval step of RAG pipelines within the legal space. LegalBench-RAG
emphasizes precise retrieval by focusing on extracting minimal, highly relevant
text segments from legal documents. These highly relevant snippets are
preferred over retrieving document IDs, or large sequences of imprecise chunks,
both of which can exceed context window limitations. Long context windows cost
more to process, induce higher latency, and lead LLMs to forget or hallucinate
information. Additionally, precise results allow LLMs to generate citations for
the end user. The LegalBench-RAG benchmark is constructed by retracing the
context used in LegalBench queries back to their original locations within the
legal corpus, resulting in a dataset of 6,858 query-answer pairs over a corpus
of over 79M characters, entirely human-annotated by legal experts. We also
introduce LegalBench-RAG-mini, a lightweight version for rapid iteration and

sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when

depth and find that while RAG can assist with reasoning, the help is limited.
If we conceptualize the reasoning process as a tree with fixed depth, then RAG
struggles to assist LLMs in performing deeper reasoning. Additionally, the
information in the documents requires preprocessing to filter out noise. We

Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to detect if a specific target document is
stored in the RAG system's knowledge database so as to protect the rights of
data producers. While research has focused on enhancing the trustworthiness of
RAG systems, existing MIAs for RAG systems remain largely insufficient.
Previous work either relies solely on the RAG system's judgment or is easily
influenced by other documents or the LLM's internal knowledge, which is
unreliable and lacks explainability. To address these limitations, we propose a
Mask-Based Membership Inference Attacks (MBA) framework. Our framework first
employs a masking algorithm that effectively masks a certain number of words in
the target document. The masked text is then used to prompt the RAG system, and
the RAG system is required to predict the mask values. If the target document
appears in the knowledge database, the masked text will retrieve the complete
target document as context, allowing for accurate mask prediction. Finally, we
adopt a simple yet effective threshold-based method to infer the membership of
target document by analyzing the accuracy of mask prediction. Our mask-based
approach is more document-specific, making the RAG system's generation less
susceptible to distractions from other documents or the LLM's internal

access to high-quality datasets have propelled the evolution of Artificial
Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). Despite its notable successes, AIGC
still faces hurdles such as updating knowledge, handling long-tail data,
mitigating data leakage, and managing high training and inference costs.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a paradigm to
address such challenges. In particular, RAG introduces the information
retrieval process, which enhances the generation process by retrieving relevant
objects from available data stores, leading to higher accuracy and better
robustness. In this paper, we comprehensively review existing efforts that
integrate RAG technique into AIGC scenarios. We first classify RAG foundations
according to how the retriever augments the generator, distilling the
fundamental abstractions of the augmentation methodologies for various
retrievers and generators. This unified perspective encompasses all RAG
scenarios, illuminating advancements and pivotal technologies that help with
potential future progress. We also summarize additional enhancements methods
for RAG, facilitating effective engineering and implementation of RAG systems.
Then from another view, we survey on practical applications of RAG across
different modalities and tasks, offering valuable references for researchers
and practitioners. Furthermore, we introduce the benchmarks for RAG, discuss
the limitations of current RAG systems, and suggest potential directions for
future research. Github: https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/RAG-Survey.",Penghao Zhao

Language Models (LLMs) to update long-tail or out-of-date knowledge is
impractical in lots of applications. To avoid fine-tuning, we can alternatively
treat a LLM as a black-box (i.e., freeze the parameters of the LLM) and augment
it with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, namely black-box RAG.
Recently, black-box RAG has achieved success in knowledge-intensive tasks and
has gained much attention. Existing black-box RAG methods typically fine-tune
the retriever to cater to LLMs' preferences and concatenate all the retrieved
documents as the input, which suffers from two issues: (1) Ignorance of Factual
Information. The LLM preferred documents may not contain the factual
information for the given question, which can mislead the retriever and hurt
the effectiveness of black-box RAG; (2) Waste of Tokens. Simply concatenating
all the retrieved documents brings large amounts of unnecessary tokens for
LLMs, which degenerates the efficiency of black-box RAG. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a novel black-box RAG framework which utilizes the
factual information in the retrieval and reduces the number of tokens for
augmentation, dubbed FIT-RAG. FIT-RAG utilizes the factual information by
constructing a bi-label document scorer. Besides, it reduces the tokens by
introducing a self-knowledge recognizer and a sub-document-level token reducer.
FIT-RAG achieves both superior effectiveness and efficiency, which is validated
by extensive experiments across three open-domain question-answering datasets:
TriviaQA, NQ and PopQA. FIT-RAG can improve the answering accuracy of
Llama2-13B-Chat by 14.3\% on TriviaQA, 19.9\% on NQ and 27.5\% on PopQA,
respectively. Furthermore, it can save approximately half of the tokens on

  Generation Applications with Agent-based Attacks","While large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in
generative tasks, they still face limitations, such as lacking up-to-date
knowledge and producing hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
enhances LLM performance by integrating external knowledge bases, providing
additional context which significantly improves accuracy and knowledge
coverage. However, building these external knowledge bases often requires
substantial resources and may involve sensitive information. In this paper, we
propose an agent-based automated privacy attack called RAG-Thief, which can
extract a scalable amount of private data from the private database used in RAG
applications. We conduct a systematic study on the privacy risks associated
with RAG applications, revealing that the vulnerability of LLMs makes the
private knowledge bases suffer significant privacy risks. Unlike previous
manual attacks which rely on traditional prompt injection techniques, RAG-Thief
starts with an initial adversarial query and learns from model responses,
progressively generating new queries to extract as many chunks from the
knowledge base as possible. Experimental results show that our RAG-Thief can
extract over 70% information from the private knowledge bases within customized
RAG applications deployed on local machines and real-world platforms, including
OpenAI's GPTs and ByteDance's Coze. Our findings highlight the privacy

analyse RAG-based in-context information, a limitation that may lead to
incorrect inferences and hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how to
elicit critical reasoning in RAG via contrastive explanations. In particular,
we propose Contrastive-RAG (C-RAG), a framework that (i) retrieves relevant
documents given a query, (ii) selects and exemplifies relevant passages, and
(iii) generates explanations that explicitly contrast the relevance of the
passages to (iv) support the final answer. We show the impact of C-RAG building
contrastive reasoning demonstrations from LLMs to instruct smaller models for

In this work, we investigate inference scaling for retrieval augmented

proxy for human values to guide optimization. However, it remains unclear how
to evaluate and select a reliable RM for preference alignment in RALMs. To this
end, we propose RAG-RewardBench, the first benchmark for evaluating RMs in RAG
settings. First, we design four crucial and challenging RAG-specific scenarios
to assess RMs, including multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation,
appropriate abstain, and conflict robustness. Then, we incorporate 18 RAG
subsets, six retrievers, and 24 RALMs to increase the diversity of data
sources. Finally, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge approach to improve preference
annotation efficiency and effectiveness, exhibiting a strong correlation with
human annotations. Based on the RAG-RewardBench, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of 45 RMs and uncover their limitations in RAG scenarios.
Additionally, we also reveal that existing trained RALMs show almost no
improvement in preference alignment, highlighting the need for a shift towards
preference-aligned training.We release our benchmark and code publicly at

that attackers can escalate RAG membership inference attacks and RAG entity
extraction attacks to RAG documents extraction attacks, forcing a more severe
outcome compared to existing attacks. We evaluate the results obtained from
three extraction methods, the influence of the type and the size of five
embeddings algorithms employed, the size of the provided context, and the GenAI
engine. We show that attackers can extract 80%-99.8% of the data stored in the

show that attackers can escalate the scale of RAG data poisoning attacks from
compromising a single GenAI-powered application to compromising the entire
GenAI ecosystem, forcing a greater scale of damage. This is done by crafting an
adversarial self-replicating prompt that triggers a chain reaction of a
computer worm within the ecosystem and forces each affected application to
perform a malicious activity and compromise the RAG of additional applications.
We evaluate the performance of the worm in creating a chain of confidential

generate responses lacking supporting evidence or based on hallucinated
evidence. While Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG) is popular to address this
issue, few studies implemented and evaluated RAG in downstream domain-specific
applications. We developed a RAG pipeline with 70,000 ophthalmology-specific
documents that retrieve relevant documents to augment LLMs during inference
time. In a case study on long-form consumer health questions, we systematically
evaluated the responses including over 500 references of LLMs with and without
RAG on 100 questions with 10 healthcare professionals. The evaluation focuses
on factuality of evidence, selection and ranking of evidence, attribution of
evidence, and answer accuracy and completeness. LLMs without RAG provided 252
references in total. Of which, 45.3% hallucinated, 34.1% consisted of minor
errors, and 20.6% were correct. In contrast, LLMs with RAG significantly
improved accuracy (54.5% being correct) and reduced error rates (18.8% with
minor hallucinations and 26.7% with errors). 62.5% of the top 10 documents
retrieved by RAG were selected as the top references in the LLM response, with
an average ranking of 4.9. The use of RAG also improved evidence attribution

Generation (RAG), which aims to augment LLMs by providing them with rich
in-context examples and information. In question-answering (QA) applications,
RAG methods embed the text of interest in chunks, and retrieve the most
relevant chunks for a prompt using text embeddings. Motivated by human memory
encoding and retrieval, we aim to improve over standard RAG methods by
generating and encoding higher-level information and tagging the chunks by
their utility to answer questions. We introduce Graphical Eigen Memories For
Retrieval Augmented Generation (GEM-RAG). GEM-RAG works by tagging each chunk
of text in a given text corpus with LLM generated ``utility'' questions,
connecting chunks in a graph based on the similarity of both their text and
utility questions, and then using the eigendecomposition of the memory graph to
build higher level summary nodes that capture the main themes of the text. We

models are by integrating external information sources such as Wikipedia,
internal documents, scientific papers, or the open internet. RAG systems that
rely on the open internet as their knowledge source have to contend with the
complexities of human-generated content. Human communication extends much
deeper than just the words rendered as text. Intent, tonality, and connotation
can all change the meaning of what is being conveyed. Recent real-world
deployments of RAG systems have shown some difficulty in understanding these
nuances of human communication. One significant challenge for these systems
lies in processing sarcasm. Though the Large Language Models (LLMs) that make
up the backbone of these RAG systems are able to detect sarcasm, they currently
do not always use these detections for the subsequent processing of text. To
address these issues, in this paper, we synthetically generate sarcastic
passages from Natural Question's Wikipedia retrieval corpus. We then test the
impact of these passages on the performance of both the retriever and reader
portion of the RAG pipeline. We introduce a prompting system designed to
enhance the model's ability to interpret and generate responses in the presence
of sarcasm, thus improving overall system performance. Finally, we conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
improvements in handling sarcastic content within RAG systems.",Benjamin Reichman

RAG systems are promising to enhance LLMs by providing them with useful and

  Graph for Long Document QA","In the past, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods split text into
chunks to enable language models to handle long documents. Recent tree-based
RAG methods are able to retrieve detailed information while preserving global
context. However, with the advent of more powerful LLMs, such as Llama 3.1,
which offer better comprehension and support for longer inputs, we found that
even recent tree-based RAG methods perform worse than directly feeding the
entire document into Llama 3.1, although RAG methods still hold an advantage in
reducing computational costs. In this paper, we propose a new retrieval method,
called LLM-Guided Dynamic Progress Control with Hierarchical Weighted Graph

Llama 3.1, while retaining the computational efficiency of RAG methods. Our
method introduces several improvements: (1) Rather than using a tree structure,
we construct a Hierarchical Weighted Directed Acyclic Graph with many-to-many
summarization, where the graph edges are derived from attention mechanisms, and
each node focuses on a single event or very few events. (2) We introduce a
novel retrieval method that leverages the attention weights of LLMs rather than
dense embedding similarity. Our method allows for searching the graph along
multiple paths and can terminate at any depth. (3) We use the LLM to control
the retrieval process, enabling it to dynamically adjust the amount and depth
of information retrieved for different queries. Experimental results show that

with providing accurate answers when lacking domain-specific or up-to-date
knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by
incorporating external knowledge bases, but it also introduces new attack
surfaces. In this paper, we investigate data extraction attacks targeting the
knowledge databases of RAG systems. We demonstrate that previous attacks on RAG
largely depend on the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs, and that
simple fine-tuning can reduce the success rate of such attacks to nearly zero.
This makes these attacks impractical since fine-tuning is a common practice
when deploying LLMs in specific domains. To further reveal the vulnerability,
we propose to backdoor RAG, where a small portion of poisoned data is injected
during the fine-tuning phase to create a backdoor within the LLM. When this
compromised LLM is integrated into a RAG system, attackers can exploit specific
triggers in prompts to manipulate the LLM to leak documents from the retrieval
database. By carefully designing the poisoned data, we achieve both verbatim
and paraphrased document extraction. We show that with only 3\% poisoned data,
our method achieves an average success rate of 79.7\% in verbatim extraction on
Llama2-7B, with a ROUGE-L score of 64.21, and a 68.6\% average success rate in

injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database, ultimately leading to
the generation of the attacker's target response (also called poisoned

such poisoning attacks. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we
introduce RevPRAG, a flexible and automated detection pipeline that leverages
the activations of LLMs for poisoned response detection. Our investigation
uncovers distinct patterns in LLMs' activations when generating correct

  Methods: We developed an LLM-RAG model using 35 preoperative guidelines and
tested it against human-generated responses, with a total of 1260 responses
evaluated. The RAG process involved converting clinical documents into text
using Python-based frameworks like LangChain and Llamaindex, and processing
these texts into chunks for embedding and retrieval. Vector storage techniques
and selected embedding models to optimize data retrieval, using Pinecone for
vector storage with a dimensionality of 1536 and cosine similarity for loss

  Results: The LLM-RAG model generated answers within an average of 15-20

Among the basic LLMs, GPT4.0 exhibited the best accuracy of 80.1%. This
accuracy was further increased to 91.4% when the model was enhanced with RAG.
Compared to the human-generated instructions, which had an accuracy of 86.3%,

language generation and information retrieval to power many real-world
applications like chatbots. Use of RAG for understanding of videos is appealing
but there are two critical limitations. One-time, upfront conversion of all
content in large corpus of videos into text descriptions entails high
processing times. Also, not all information in the rich video data is typically
captured in the text descriptions. Since user queries are not known apriori,
developing a system for video to text conversion and interactive querying of
video data is challenging.
  To address these limitations, we propose an incremental RAG system called
iRAG, which augments RAG with a novel incremental workflow to enable
interactive querying of a large corpus of videos. Unlike traditional RAG, iRAG
quickly indexes large repositories of videos, and in the incremental workflow,
it uses the index to opportunistically extract more details from select
portions of the videos to retrieve context relevant to an interactive user
query. Such an incremental workflow avoids long video to text conversion times,
and overcomes information loss issues due to conversion of video to text, by
doing on-demand query-specific extraction of details in video data. This
ensures high quality of responses to interactive user queries that are often
not known apriori. To the best of our knowledge, iRAG is the first system to
augment RAG with an incremental workflow to support efficient interactive
querying of a large corpus of videos. Experimental results on real-world

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique to

generation of an LLM on external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge database.
Existing studies mainly focus on improving the accuracy or efficiency of RAG,

We find that the knowledge database in a RAG system introduces a new and

the first knowledge corruption attack to RAG, where an attacker could inject a
few malicious texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce an
LLM to generate an attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen target

whose solution is a set of malicious texts. Depending on the background
knowledge (e.g., black-box and white-box settings) of an attacker on a RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique for improving the
performance of LLMs on tasks that the models weren't explicitly trained on, by
leveraging external knowledge databases. Numerous studies have demonstrated the
effectiveness of RAG to more successfully accomplish downstream tasks when
using vector datasets that consist of relevant background information. It has
been implicitly assumed by those in the field that if adversarial background
information is utilized in this context, that the success of using a RAG-based
approach would be nonexistent or even negatively impact the results. To address
this assumption, we tested several open-source LLMs on the ability of RAG to
improve their success in answering multiple-choice questions (MCQ) in the
medical subspecialty field of Nephrology. Unlike previous studies, we examined
the effect of RAG in utilizing both relevant and adversarial background
databases. We set up several open-source LLMs, including Llama 3, Phi-3,
Mixtral 8x7b, Zephyr$\beta$, and Gemma 7B Instruct, in a zero-shot RAG
pipeline. As adversarial sources of information, text from the Bible and a
Random Words generated database were used for comparison. Our data show that
most of the open-source LLMs improve their multiple-choice test-taking success
as expected when incorporating relevant information vector databases.
Surprisingly however, adversarial Bible text significantly improved the success
of many LLMs and even random word text improved test taking ability of some of
the models. In summary, our results demonstrate for the first time the

that effective retrieval from long-form conversational data faces two unique
problems compared to static database retrieval: 1) time/event-based queries,
which requires the model to retrieve information about previous conversations
based on time or the order of a conversational event (e.g., the third
conversation on Tuesday), and 2) ambiguous queries that require surrounding
conversational context to understand. To better develop RAG-based agents that
can deal with these challenges, we generate a new dataset of ambiguous and
time-based questions that build upon a recent dataset of long-form, simulated

Re-weighting (PEAR), which enhances the context awareness of LLMs with zero

diminishing RAG performance. To weaken the impact of these heads, we re-weight
their outputs with learnable coefficients. The LLM (with frozen parameters) is
optimized by adjusting these coefficients to minimize loss on the proxy task.
As a result, the coefficients are optimized to values less than one, thereby

extended for multilingual generation evaluation. MIRAGE-Bench evaluates RAG
extensively coupling both heuristic features and LLM as a judge evaluator. In
our work, we benchmark 19 diverse multilingual-focused LLMs, and achieve a high

  Secret or Forget Knowledge?","The deployment of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini has
shown their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these
models can inadvertently learn and retain sensitive information and harmful
content during training, raising significant ethical and legal concerns. To
address these issues, machine unlearning has been introduced as a potential
solution. While existing unlearning methods take into account the specific
characteristics of LLMs, they often suffer from high computational demands,
limited applicability, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these
limitations, we propose a lightweight unlearning framework based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. By modifying the external
knowledge base of RAG, we simulate the effects of forgetting without directly
interacting with the unlearned LLM. We approach the construction of unlearned
knowledge as a constrained optimization problem, deriving two key components
that underpin the effectiveness of RAG-based unlearning. This RAG-based
approach is particularly effective for closed-source LLMs, where existing
unlearning methods often fail. We evaluate our framework through extensive
experiments on both open-source and closed-source models, including ChatGPT,
Gemini, Llama-2-7b-chat-hf, and PaLM 2. The results demonstrate that our
approach meets five key unlearning criteria: effectiveness, universality,
harmlessness, simplicity, and robustness. Meanwhile, this approach can extend
to multimodal large language models and LLM-based agents.",Shang Wang

disrupts the global long-context information, and its low-quality retrieval in
long contexts hinders LLMs from identifying effective factual details due to
substantial noise. To this end, we propose LongRAG, a general,

LLMs are expected to mimic human replies. This has promoted the exploration of
role-playing agents in various applications, such as chatbots that can engage
in natural conversations with users and virtual assistants that can provide
personalized support and guidance. The crucial factor in the role-playing task
is the effective utilization of character memory, which stores characters'

emotional factor in the retrieval argument generation (RAG) of LLMs. Inspired
by the Mood-Dependent Memory theory, which indicates that people recall an

experienced during learning, we propose a novel emotion-aware memory retrieval
framework, termed Emotional RAG, which recalls the related memory with
consideration of emotional state in role-playing agents. Specifically, we
design two kinds of retrieval strategies, i.e., combination strategy and
sequential strategy, to incorporate both memory semantic and emotional states

Previous approaches typically train retrievers based on semantic similarity,
lacking optimization for RAG. More recent works have proposed aligning
retrievers with the preference signals of LLMs. However, these preference
signals are often difficult for dense retrievers, which typically have weaker
language capabilities, to understand and learn effectively. Drawing inspiration
from pedagogical theories like Guided Discovery Learning, we propose a novel

language capabilities of LLMs to construct examples from a more granular,
information-centric perspective to guide the learning of retrievers.
Specifically, our method utilizes LLMs to construct easy-to-understand examples
from samples where the retriever performs poorly, focusing on three learning
objectives highly relevant to the RAG scenario: relevance, comprehensiveness,
and purity. These examples serve as scaffolding to ultimately align the
retriever with the LLM's preferences. Furthermore, we employ a dual curriculum
learning strategy and leverage the reciprocal feedback between LLM and
retriever to further enhance the performance of the RAG system. A series of

can modify specific unsatisfied regions in the last generation while keeping

providing reliable answer predictions and addressing hallucination problems. A
typical RAG implementation uses powerful retrieval models to extract external
information and large language models (LLMs) to generate answers. In contrast,
recent LLM-based retrieval has gained attention for its substantial
improvements in information retrieval (IR) due to the LLMs' semantic
understanding capability. However, directly applying LLM to RAG systems
presents challenges. This may cause feature locality problems as massive
parametric knowledge can hinder effective usage of global information across
the corpus; for example, an LLM-based retriever often inputs document summaries
instead of full documents. Moreover, various pre-trained tasks in LLMs
introduce variance, further weakening performance as a retriever.
  To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning
architecture called Invar-RAG. In the retrieval stage, an LLM-based retriever
is constructed by integrating LoRA-based representation learning to tackle
feature locality issues. To enhance retrieval performance, we develop two
patterns (invariant and variant patterns) and an invariance loss to reduce LLM
variance. In the generation stage, a refined fine-tuning method is employed to
improve LLM accuracy in generating answers based on retrieved information.

in-house retrieval embedding model using infoNCE loss, and experimental results
demonstrate that the in-house model works significantly better than the
well-known general-purpose public embedding model, both in terms of retrieval

(e.g., follow-up queries). Hence, there is a scope to optimize the number of
LLM tokens and cost. Assuming a fixed retrieval model and an LLM, we optimize
the number of LLM tokens using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, we
propose a policy-based model external to the RAG, which interacts with the RAG
pipeline through policy actions and updates the policy to optimize the cost.
The policy model can perform two actions: to fetch FAQ context or skip
retrieval. We use the open API-based GPT-4 as the reward model. We then train a
policy model using policy gradient on multiple training chat sessions. As a
policy model, we experimented with a public gpt-2 model and an in-house BERT

this study used 61 prescribing error scenarios embedded into 23 complex

attack surface for LLMs, particularly because RAG databases are often sourced

identify the vulnerabilities and attacks on retrieval parts (RAG database) and
their indirect attacks on generative parts (LLMs). Specifically, we identify
that poisoning several customized content passages could achieve a retrieval
backdoor, where the retrieval works well for clean queries but always returns

highly customized to implement various attacks. For example, a trigger could be
a semantic group like ""The Republican Party, Donald Trump, etc."" Adversarial
passages can be tailored to different contents, not only linked to the triggers

filling unwanted catchment basins, on which a subsequent watershed transform
extracts the targeted objects. Flooding a topographic surface may be modeled as
flooding a node weighted graph (TG), with unweighted edges, the node weights
representing the ground level. The progression of a flooding may also be
modeled on the region adjacency graph (RAG) of a topographic surface. On a RAG
each node represents a catchment basin and edges connect neighboring nodes. The
edges are weighted by the altitude of the pass point between both adjacent
regions. The graph is flooded from sources placed at the marker positions and
each node is assigned to the source by which it has been flooded. The level of
the flood is represented on the nodes on each type of graphs. The same flooding
may thus be modeled on a TG or on a RAG. We characterize all valid floodings on
both types of graphs, as they should verify the laws of hydrostatics. We then
show that each flooding of a node weighted graph also is a flooding of an edge
weighted graph with appropriate edge weights. The highest flooding under a
ceiling function may be interpreted as the shortest distance to the root for
the ultrametric flooding distance in an augmented graph. The ultrametric
distance between two nodes is the minimal altitude of a flooding for which both
nodes are flooded. This remark permits to flood edge or node weighted graphs by
using shortest path algorithms. It appears that the collection of all lakes of

  Internet of Medical Things: A Diffusion-based Contract Approach","Secure data management and effective data sharing have become paramount in
the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, especially with the growing
integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The rise of generative
artificial intelligence has further elevated Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) as essential tools for managing and optimizing healthcare data in IoMT.
MLLMs can support multi-modal inputs and generate diverse types of content by
leveraging large-scale training on vast amounts of multi-modal data. However,
critical challenges persist in developing medical MLLMs, including security and
freshness issues of healthcare data, affecting the output quality of MLLMs. To
this end, in this paper, we propose a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG)-empowered medical MLLM framework for healthcare data management. This
framework leverages a hierarchical cross-chain architecture to facilitate
secure data training. Moreover, it enhances the output quality of MLLMs through
hybrid RAG, which employs multi-modal metrics to filter various unimodal RAG
results and incorporates these retrieval results as additional inputs to MLLMs.
Additionally, we employ age of information to indirectly evaluate the data
freshness impact of MLLMs and utilize contract theory to incentivize healthcare
data holders to share their fresh data, mitigating information asymmetry during
data sharing. Finally, we utilize a generative diffusion model-based deep
reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the optimal contract for efficient
data sharing. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
schemes, which achieve secure and efficient healthcare data management.",Cheng Su

more. However, evaluating the output quality of such systems on long-context
tasks remains challenging, as tasks like Needle-in-a-Haystack lack complexity.
In this work, we argue that summarization can play a central role in such
evaluation. We design a procedure to synthesize Haystacks of documents,
ensuring that specific \textit{insights} repeat across documents. The ""Summary
of a Haystack"" (SummHay) task then requires a system to process the Haystack
and generate, given a query, a summary that identifies the relevant insights
and precisely cites the source documents. Since we have precise knowledge of
what insights should appear in a haystack summary and what documents should be
cited, we implement a highly reproducible automatic evaluation that can score
summaries on two aspects - Coverage and Citation. We generate Haystacks in two
domains (conversation, news), and perform a large-scale evaluation of 10 LLMs
and corresponding 50 RAG systems. Our findings indicate that SummHay is an open
challenge for current systems, as even systems provided with an Oracle signal
of document relevance lag our estimate of human performance (56\%) by 10+
points on a Joint Score. Without a retriever, long-context LLMs like GPT-4o and
Claude 3 Opus score below 20% on SummHay. We show SummHay can also be used to
study enterprise RAG systems and position bias in long-context models. We hope
future systems can equal and surpass human performance on SummHay.",Philippe Laban

a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism, retrieving past knowledge and
instances with similar embeddings from knowledge bases to inform task planning
and execution. However, the reliance on unverified knowledge bases raises
significant concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. To uncover such
vulnerabilities, we propose a novel red teaming approach AgentPoison, the first
backdoor attack targeting generic and RAG-based LLM agents by poisoning their
long-term memory or RAG knowledge base. In particular, we form the trigger
generation process as a constrained optimization to optimize backdoor triggers
by mapping the triggered instances to a unique embedding space, so as to ensure
that whenever a user instruction contains the optimized backdoor trigger, the
malicious demonstrations are retrieved from the poisoned memory or knowledge
base with high probability. In the meantime, benign instructions without the
trigger will still maintain normal performance. Unlike conventional backdoor
attacks, AgentPoison requires no additional model training or fine-tuning, and
the optimized backdoor trigger exhibits superior transferability, in-context
coherence, and stealthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentPoison's
effectiveness in attacking three types of real-world LLM agents: RAG-based
autonomous driving agent, knowledge-intensive QA agent, and healthcare
EHRAgent. On each agent, AgentPoison achieves an average attack success rate
higher than 80% with minimal impact on benign performance (less than 1%) with a

responses. Such RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems retrieve from
massive heterogeneous data stores that are usually architected as multiple
indexes or APIs instead of a single monolithic source. For a given query,
relevant evidence needs to be retrieved from one or a small subset of possible
retrieval sources. Complex queries can even require multi-step retrieval. For
example, a conversational agent on a retail site answering customer questions
about past orders will need to retrieve the appropriate customer order first
and then the evidence relevant to the customer's question in the context of the
ordered product. Most RAG Agents handle such Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks by
interleaving reasoning and retrieval steps. However, each reasoning step
directly adds to the latency of the system. For large models this latency cost
is significant -- in the order of multiple seconds. Multi-agent systems may
classify the query to a single Agent associated with a retrieval source, though
this means that a (small) classification model dictates the performance of a
large language model. In this work we present REAPER (REAsoning-based PlannER)
- an LLM based planner to generate retrieval plans in conversational systems.

poisoning attacks in medical Q\&A. In such attacks, adversaries generate
poisoned documents containing a broad spectrum of targeted information, such as
personally identifiable information. When these poisoned documents are inserted
into a corpus, they can be accurately retrieved by any users, as long as

confabulation of large language models (LLMs) for question answering by
retrieving and providing additional context coming from external knowledge
sources (e.g., by adding the context to the prompt). However, injecting
incorrect information can mislead the LLM to generate an incorrect answer.
  In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of four LLMs
against misinformation - Gemma 2, GPT-4o-mini, Llama~3.1, and Mixtral - in
answering biomedical questions. We assess the answer accuracy on yes-no and
free-form questions in three scenarios: vanilla LLM answers (no context is
provided), ""perfect"" augmented generation (correct context is provided), and
prompt-injection attacks (incorrect context is provided). Our results show that
Llama 3.1 (70B parameters) achieves the highest accuracy in both vanilla
(0.651) and ""perfect"" RAG (0.802) scenarios. However, the accuracy gap between
the models almost disappears with ""perfect"" RAG, suggesting its potential to
mitigate the LLM's size-related effectiveness differences.
  We further evaluate the ability of the LLMs to generate malicious context on
one hand and the LLM's robustness against prompt-injection attacks on the other
hand, using metrics such as attack success rate (ASR), accuracy under attack,
and accuracy drop. As adversaries, we use the same four LLMs (Gemma 2,
GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1, and Mixtral) to generate incorrect context that is
injected in the target model's prompt. Interestingly, Llama is shown to be the
most effective adversary, causing accuracy drops of up to 0.48 for vanilla
answers and 0.63 for ""perfect"" RAG across target models. Our analysis reveals
that robustness rankings vary depending on the evaluation measure, highlighting
the complexity of assessing LLM resilience to adversarial attacks.",Alexander Bondarenko

LLMs are highly capable, they often rely on static, pre-trained datasets,

systems typically use a single-agent architecture to handle query generation,
data retrieval, and response synthesis. However, this approach becomes
inefficient when dealing with diverse data sources, such as relational

bottlenecks and reduced accuracy. This paper proposes a multi-agent RAG system
to address these limitations. Specialized agents, each optimized for a specific
data source, handle query generation for relational, NoSQL, and document-based
systems. These agents collaborate within a modular framework, with query
execution delegated to an environment designed for compatibility across various
database types. This distributed approach enhances query efficiency, reduces
token overhead, and improves response accuracy by ensuring that each agent
focuses on its specialized task. The proposed system is scalable and adaptable,

limitation poses challenges in practical applications, especially when LLMs are
already deployed, as parameter adjustments may affect their original

learning scalable and pluggable virtual tokens for RAG. By maintaining the
LLMs' original parameters and fine-tuning only the embeddings of these
pluggable tokens, our approach not only enhances LLMs' performance but also
preserves their general generation capabilities. Furthermore, we design several

mainly consists of retrieval and generation. The retrieval modules (a.k.a.
retrievers) aim to find useful information used to facilitate generation
modules (a.k.a. generators). As such, generators' performance largely depends
on the effectiveness and efficiency of retrievers. However, the retrieval
paradigm that we design and use remains flat, which treats the retrieval
procedures as a one-off deal with constant granularity. Despite effectiveness,
we argue that they suffer from two limitations: (1) flat retrieval exerts a
significant burden on one retriever; (2) constant granularity limits the
ceiling of retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a progressive
retrieval paradigm with coarse-to-fine granularity for RAG, termed FunnelRAG,
so as to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, FunnelRAG
establishes a progressive retrieval pipeline by collaborating coarse-to-fine
granularity, large-to-small quantity, and low-to-high capacity, which can
relieve the burden on one retriever and also promote the ceiling of retrieval
performance. Extensive experiments manifest that FunnelRAG achieves comparable

models (LLMs) are expected to ground their generation to the retrieved
contexts. Yet, this is hindered by position bias of LLMs, failing to evenly
attend to all contexts. Previous work has addressed this by synthesizing
contexts with perturbed positions of gold segment, creating a
position-diversified train set. We extend this intuition to propose consistency
regularization with augmentation and distillation. First, we augment each
training instance with its position perturbation to encourage consistent
predictions, regardless of ordering. We also distill behaviors of this pair,
although it can be counterproductive in certain RAG scenarios where the given
order from the retriever is crucial for generation quality. We thus propose
CORD, balancing COnsistency and Rank Distillation. CORD adaptively samples
noise-controlled perturbations from an interpolation space, ensuring both
consistency and respect for the rank prior. Empirical results show this balance
enables CORD to outperform consistently in diverse RAG benchmarks.",Youngwon Lee

  Generation","Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to generating hallucinated
information, despite the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Parallel context extension (PCE) is a line of research attempting to
effectively integrating parallel (unordered) contexts, while it still suffers
from hallucinations when adapted to RAG scenarios. In this paper, we propose
DePaC (Dehallucinating Parallel Context Extension), which alleviates the
hallucination problem with context-aware negative training and
information-calibrated aggregation. DePaC is designed to alleviate two types of
in-context hallucination: fact fabrication (i.e., LLMs present claims that are
not supported by the contexts) and fact omission (i.e., LLMs fail to present
claims that can be supported by the contexts). Specifically, (1) for fact
fabrication, we apply the context-aware negative training that fine-tunes the
LLMs with negative supervisions, thus explicitly guiding the LLMs to refuse to
answer when contexts are not related to questions; (2) for fact omission, we
propose the information-calibrated aggregation which prioritizes context
windows with higher information increment from their contexts. The experimental
results on nine RAG tasks demonstrate that DePaC significantly alleviates the
two types of hallucination and consistently achieves better performances on
these tasks.",Zexiong Ma

incorporate new knowledge not present in their pre-training data. The primary

Although RAG has emerged as the industry standard for knowledge injection,

a new fine-tuning technique for learning new knowledge and show that it can
reach the performance of RAG. The proposed method is based on the
self-distillation approach, which we call prompt distillation. First, we
generate question-answer pairs about the new knowledge. Then, we fine-tune a
student model on the question-answer pairs to imitate the output distributions
of a teacher model, which additionally receives the new knowledge in its
prompt. The student model is identical to the teacher, except it is equipped
with a LoRA adapter. This training procedure facilitates distilling the new

still face challenges in knowledge-intensive domains like biomedicine.
Solutions such as pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning add substantial
computational overhead, requiring further domain expertise. Here, we introduce
a token-optimized and robust Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Augmented
Generation (KG-RAG) framework by leveraging a massive biomedical KG (SPOKE)
with LLMs such as Llama-2-13b, GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, to generate meaningful
biomedical text rooted in established knowledge. Compared to the existing RAG
technique for Knowledge Graphs, the proposed method utilizes minimal graph
schema for context extraction and uses embedding methods for context pruning.
This optimization in context extraction results in more than 50% reduction in
token consumption without compromising the accuracy, making a cost-effective
and robust RAG implementation on proprietary LLMs. KG-RAG consistently enhanced
the performance of LLMs across diverse biomedical prompts by generating
responses rooted in established knowledge, accompanied by accurate provenance
and statistical evidence (if available) to substantiate the claims. Further
benchmarking on human curated datasets, such as biomedical true/false and
multiple-choice questions (MCQ), showed a remarkable 71% boost in the
performance of the Llama-2 model on the challenging MCQ dataset, demonstrating
the framework's capacity to empower open-source models with fewer parameters

various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions with and without
access to additional online information via RAG. Using 80 questions from RSNA
Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24 additional

i-MedRAG, the follow-up queries will be answered by a conventional RAG system

Mathematically, much as in the commutative case, free convexity is connected
with free positivity through the second derivative: A free polynomial is convex
if and only if its Hessian is positive. However, free convexity is a very

chunking and adapting language models to handle longer contexts, have their
limitations. These methods either disrupt the semantic coherence of the text or
fail to effectively address the issues of noise and inaccuracy in evidence

  CFIC addresses these challenges by circumventing the conventional chunking
process. It utilizes the encoded hidden states of documents for in-context

chunking. CFIC is further enhanced by incorporating two decoding strategies,
namely Constrained Sentence Prefix Decoding and Skip Decoding. These strategies
not only improve the efficiency of the retrieval process but also ensure that
the fidelity of the generated grounding text evidence is maintained. Our
evaluations of CFIC on a range of open QA datasets demonstrate its superiority

samples being copied in the model's output. To reduce risks of leaking private
information contained in the retrieved set, we introduce Copy-Protected
generation with Retrieval (CPR), a new method for RAG with strong copyright
protection guarantees in a mixed-private setting for diffusion models.CPR
allows to condition the output of diffusion models on a set of retrieved
images, while also guaranteeing that unique identifiable information about
those example is not exposed in the generated outputs. In particular, it does
so by sampling from a mixture of public (safe) distribution and private (user)
distribution by merging their diffusion scores at inference. We prove that CPR
satisfies Near Access Freeness (NAF) which bounds the amount of information an
attacker may be able to extract from the generated images. We provide two
algorithms for copyright protection, CPR-KL and CPR-Choose. Unlike previously
proposed rejection-sampling-based NAF methods, our methods enable efficient
copyright-protected sampling with a single run of backward diffusion. We show
that our method can be applied to any pre-trained conditional diffusion model,
such as Stable Diffusion or unCLIP. In particular, we empirically show that
applying CPR on top of unCLIP improves quality and text-to-image alignment of
the generated results (81.4 to 83.17 on TIFA benchmark), while enabling credit
attribution, copy-right protection, and deterministic, constant time,
unlearning.",Aditya Golatkar

endowing models with the capability of CAG. Furthermore, to accurately evaluate
the models' capabilities of CAG, we construct a comprehensive benchmark

verified the ability of LLMs to extract information as well as to know the
missing. Based on the above discovery, we propose a Missing Information Guided
Retrieve-Extraction-Solving paradigm (MIGRES), where we leverage the
identification of missing information to generate a targeted query that steers

  for Medical Applications","Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in natural

applications across diverse domains. In the medical domain, open-source LLMs
have demonstrated moderate efficacy following domain-specific fine-tuning;
however, they remain substantially inferior to proprietary models such as GPT-4

comprehensiveness of domain-specific knowledge and exhibit a propensity for
'hallucinations' during text generation. To mitigate these issues, researchers
have implemented the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, which
augments LLMs with background information from external knowledge bases while
preserving the model's internal parameters. However, document noise can
adversely affect performance, and the application of RAG in the medical field
remains in its nascent stages. This study presents the Bailicai framework: a
novel integration of retrieval-augmented generation with large language models
optimized for the medical domain. The Bailicai framework augments the
performance of LLMs in medicine through the implementation of four sub-modules.
Experimental results demonstrate that the Bailicai approach surpasses existing
medical domain LLMs across multiple medical benchmarks and exceeds the
performance of GPT-3.5. Furthermore, the Bailicai method effectively attenuates
the prevalent issue of hallucinations in medical applications of LLMs and
ameliorates the noise-related challenges associated with traditional RAG

Fine-tuning, on the other hand, can produce quite small, still strong expert
models, but poses the danger of overfitting. Our study further asks how we
measure performance of LLMs and how well current measurements represent
correctness or relevance? We find high correlation on similarity metrics and a
bias of most of these metrics towards shorter responses. Overall, our research

Large Language Model or LLM applications. RAG involves taking a user query and
finding relevant paragraphs of context in a large corpus typically captured in
a vector database. Once the first level of search happens over a vector
database, the top n chunks of relevant text are included directly in the
context and sent as prompt to the LLM. Problem with this approach is that
quality of text chunks depends on effectiveness of search. There is no strong
post processing after search to determine if the chunk does hold enough
information to include in prompt. Also many times there may be chunks that have
conflicting information on the same subject and the model has no prior
experience which chunk to prioritize to make a decision. Often times, this
leads to the model providing a statement that there are conflicting statements,
and it cannot produce an answer. In this research we propose a Bayesian
approach to verify the quality of text chunks from the search results. Bayes
theorem tries to relate conditional probabilities of the hypothesis with
evidence and prior probabilities. We propose that, finding likelihood of text
chunks to give a quality answer and using prior probability of quality of text
chunks can help us improve overall quality of the responses from RAG systems.
We can use the LLM itself to get a likelihood of relevance of a context
paragraph. For prior probability of the text chunk, we use the page number in
the documents parsed. Assumption is that that paragraphs in earlier pages have
a better probability of being findings and more relevant to generalizing an

healthcare, reaching the performance of domain experts on tasks such as
question answering and document summarisation. Despite their success on these
tasks, it is unclear how well LLMs perform on tasks that are traditionally
pursued in the biomedical domain, such as structured information extration. To
breach this gap, in this paper, we systematically benchmark LLM performance in
Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. We aim to
disentangle the contribution of different factors to the performance,
particularly the impact of LLMs' task knowledge and reasoning capabilities,
their (parametric) domain knowledge, and addition of external knowledge. To
this end we evaluate various open LLMs -- including BioMistral and Llama-2

Counter-intuitively, our results reveal that standard prompting consistently
outperforms more complex techniques across both tasks, laying bare the
limitations in the current application of CoT, self-consistency and RAG in the
biomedical domain. Our findings suggest that advanced prompting methods
developed for knowledge- or reasoning-intensive tasks, such as CoT or RAG, are
not easily portable to biomedical tasks where precise structured outputs are
required. This highlights the need for more effective integration of external

  Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models","In a real-world RAG system, the current query often involves spoken ellipses
and ambiguous references from dialogue contexts, necessitating query rewriting
to better describe user's information needs. However, traditional context-based
rewriting has minimal enhancement on downstream generation tasks due to the
lengthy process from query rewriting to response generation. Some researchers
try to utilize reinforcement learning with generation feedback to assist the
rewriter, but these sparse rewards provide little guidance in most cases,
leading to unstable training and generation results. We find that user's needs
are also reflected in the gold document, retrieved documents and ground truth.
Therefore, by feeding back these multi-aspect dense rewards to query rewriting,
more stable and satisfactory responses can be achieved. In this paper, we
propose a novel query rewriting method MaFeRw, which improves RAG performance
by integrating multi-aspect feedback from both the retrieval process and
generated results. Specifically, we first use manual data to train a T5 model
for the rewriter initialization. Next, we design three metrics as reinforcement
learning feedback: the similarity between the rewritten query and the gold
document, the ranking metrics, and ROUGE between the generation and the ground
truth. Inspired by RLAIF, we train three kinds of reward models for the above
metrics to achieve more efficient training. Finally, we combine the scores of
these reward models as feedback, and use PPO algorithm to explore the optimal

clues and make the inference process slow and expensive. Therefore, context
compression is necessary to enhance its accuracy and efficiency. Existing
context compression methods use extractive or generative models to retain the
most query-relevant sentences or apply the information bottleneck theory to
preserve sufficient information. However, these methods may face issues such as
over-compression or high computational costs. We observe that the retriever
often ranks relevant documents at the top, but the exact number of documents
needed to answer the query is uncertain due to the impact of query complexity
and retrieval quality: complex queries like multi-hop questions may require
retaining more documents than simpler queries, and a low-quality retrieval may
need to rely on more documents to generate accurate outputs. Therefore,
determining the minimum number of required documents (compression rate) is
still a challenge for RAG. In this paper, we introduce AdaComp, a low-cost
extractive context compression method that adaptively determines the
compression rate based on both query complexity and retrieval quality.
Specifically, we first annotate the minimum top-k documents necessary for the
RAG system to answer the current query as the compression rate and then
construct triplets of the query, retrieved documents, and its compression rate.
Then, we use this triplet dataset to train a compression-rate predictor.
Experiments on three QA datasets and one conversational Muiti-doc QA dataset

Alternatively, lightweight natural language inference (NLI) models for

grounding LLM outputs in structured external knowledge from KGs. However,
current KG-based RAG frameworks still struggle to optimize the trade-off

extending the KG-based RAG framework that retrieves subgraphs and leverages
LLMs for reasoning and answer prediction. Our approach innovatively integrates
a lightweight multilayer perceptron with a parallel triple-scoring mechanism

structural distances to enhance retrieval effectiveness. The size of retrieved
subgraphs can be flexibly adjusted to match the query's need and the downstream

supervised fine-tuning (SFT), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) technologies to inject

  \textbf{Methods:} We used four core DS information extraction tasks - namely,
named entity recognition (NER: 2,949 clinical sentences), relation extraction

tailor interactions, drawing from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and
narrative therapy techniques. A key challenge in the development process was
the difficulty of translating declarative knowledge into effective interaction
behaviors. In the initial phase, the chatbot was provided with declarative
knowledge about CBT via reference textbooks and high-level conversational
goals. However, this approach resulted in imprecise and inefficient behavior,
as the GPT model struggled to convert static information into dynamic and
contextually appropriate interactions. This highlighted the limitations of
relying solely on declarative knowledge to guide chatbot behavior, particularly
in nuanced, therapeutic conversations. Over four iterations, we addressed this
issue by gradually transitioning towards procedural knowledge, refining the
chatbot's interaction strategies, and improving its overall effectiveness. In
the final evaluation, 5 participants engaged with the chatbot over five

both the effectiveness and efficiency of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

models fail to rank the most relevant documents, leading to the inclusion of
more context at the expense of latency and accuracy. While abstractive
compression methods can drastically reduce token counts, their token-by-token
generation process significantly increases end-to-end latency. Conversely,
existing extractive methods reduce latency but rely on independent,
non-adaptive sentence selection, failing to fully utilize contextual

retrieved documents - while preserving their contextual dependencies - enabling
parallelizable, context-aware extraction that adapts to query complexity and

referencing them to a predetermined ontology. It was shown that using a
Knowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into
account relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured
manner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM

automatic model selection. Pairing our RAG with a domain-specific: (i) KG

attribute the source of information, mitigate hallucinations, lessen the need
for fine-tuning, and excel in highly domain-specific question answering tasks.
We pair SMART-SLIC with chain-of-thought prompting agents. The framework is

(Bubeck et al., 2023)) on modern LLMs have shown that they are capable of
performing amazing tasks typically necessitating human-level intelligence.
However, unlike humans, frozen LLMs do not improve over time; they neither
acquire new knowledge nor learn from their successes or failures. Some
approaches to improving the intelligence of LLMs include fine-tuning models
based on problem-solving performance (Zelikman et al., 2022), and building
bigger and more sophisticated models (Bubeck et al., 2023). However, these
methods have the drawback of requiring substantial data and computational
resources to retrain existing models. In this paper, we explore the use of
Retrieval Augmented Generation, also known as RAG (Lewis et al., 2021) to
improve problem-solving performance. We propose ARM-RAG (Auxiliary Rationale
Memory for Retrieval Augmented Generation), a system that learns from its
successes without incurring high training costs. We demonstrate that the

  Models","Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in critical fields such as
healthcare, education, and finance due to their remarkable proficiency in
various language-related tasks. However, LLMs are prone to generating factually
incorrect responses or ""hallucinations,"" which can lead to a loss of
credibility and trust among users. To address this issue, we propose a
multi-stage framework that generates the rationale first, verifies and refines
incorrect ones, and uses them as supporting references to generate the answer.
The generated rationale enhances the transparency of the answer and our
framework provides insights into how the model arrived at this answer, by using
this rationale and the references to the context. In this paper, we demonstrate
its effectiveness in improving the quality of responses to drug-related
inquiries in the life sciences industry. Our framework improves traditional
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by enabling OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo to be
14-25% more faithful and 16-22% more accurate on two datasets. Furthermore,

unsupervised fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate
both approaches on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks across different
topics. Our findings reveal that while unsupervised fine-tuning offers some
improvement, RAG consistently outperforms it, both for existing knowledge
encountered during training and entirely new knowledge. Moreover, we find that
LLMs struggle to learn new factual information through unsupervised
fine-tuning, and that exposing them to numerous variations of the same fact

unprecedented ways. This work investigates methodologies for generating
tailored fashion descriptions using two distinct Large Language Models and a
Stable Diffusion model for fashion image creation. Emphasizing adaptability in
AI-driven fashion creativity, we depart from traditional approaches and focus
on prompting techniques, such as zero-shot and few-shot learning, as well as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which results in a variety of colors and textures,
enhancing the diversity of the outputs. Central to our methodology is
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enriching models with insights from
fashion sources to ensure contemporary representations. Evaluation combines
quantitative metrics such as CLIPscore with qualitative human judgment,
highlighting strengths in creativity, coherence, and aesthetic appeal across
diverse styles. Among the participants, RAG and few-shot learning techniques
are preferred for their ability to produce more relevant and appealing fashion
descriptions. Our code is provided at https://github.com/georgiarg/AutoFashion.",Georgia Argyrou

domain-specific knowledge retrieval, one in the academic domain and the other
in the financial domain. The effectiveness of the methods has been validated

overly optimistic assumptions like non-collusion among parties); and (ii)
maintaining performance overheads comparable to traditional, non-federated RAG

  on How to Make your LLMs use External Data More Wisely","Large language models (LLMs) augmented with external data have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in completing real-world tasks. Techniques for
integrating external data into LLMs, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and fine-tuning, are gaining increasing attention and widespread
application. Nonetheless, the effective deployment of data-augmented LLMs
across various specialized fields presents substantial challenges. These
challenges encompass a wide range of issues, from retrieving relevant data and
accurately interpreting user intent to fully harnessing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for complex tasks. We believe that there is no
one-size-fits-all solution for data-augmented LLM applications. In practice,
underperformance often arises from a failure to correctly identify the core
focus of a task or because the task inherently requires a blend of multiple
capabilities that must be disentangled for better resolution. In this survey,
we propose a RAG task categorization method, classifying user queries into four
levels based on the type of external data required and primary focus of the
task: explicit fact queries, implicit fact queries, interpretable rationale
queries, and hidden rationale queries. We define these levels of queries,
provide relevant datasets, and summarize the key challenges and most effective
techniques for addressing these challenges. Finally, we discuss three main
forms of integrating external data into LLMs: context, small model, and
fine-tuning, highlighting their respective strengths, limitations, and the
types of problems they are suited to solve. This work aims to help readers
thoroughly understand and decompose the data requirements and key bottlenecks
in building LLM applications, offering solutions to the different challenges
and serving as a guide to systematically developing such applications.",Siyun Zhao

2020-02-14T18:58:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06187v1,"Reusing Static Analysis across Different Domain-Specific Languages using
  Reference Attribute Grammars","Context: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) enable domain experts to specify
tasks and problems themselves, while enabling static analysis to elucidate
issues in the modelled domain early. Although language workbenches have
simplified the design of DSLs and extensions to general purpose languages,
static analyses must still be implemented manually.
  Inquiry: Moreover, static analyses, e.g., complexity metrics, dependency
analysis, and declaration-use analysis, are usually domain-dependent and cannot
be easily reused. Therefore, transferring existing static analyses to another
DSL incurs a huge implementation overhead. However, this overhead is not always
intrinsically necessary: in many cases, while the concepts of the DSL on which
a static analysis is performed are domain-specific, the underlying algorithm
employed in the analysis is actually domain-independent and thus can be reused
in principle, depending on how it is specified. While current approaches either
implement static analyses internally or with an external Visitor, the
implementation is tied to the language's grammar and cannot be reused easily.
Thus far, a commonly used approach that achieves reusable static analysis
relies on the transformation into an intermediate representation upon which the
analysis is performed. This, however, entails a considerable additional
implementation effort.
  Approach: To remedy this, it has been proposed to map the necessary
domain-specific concepts to the algorithm's domain-independent data structures,
yet without a practical implementation and the demonstration of reuse. Thus, to
make static analysis reusable again, we employ relational Reference Attribute
Grammars (RAGs) by creating such a mapping to a domain-independent overlay
structure using higher-order attributes.
  Knowledge: We describe how static analysis can be specified on
analysis-specific data structures, how relational RAGs can help with the
specification, and how a mapping from the domain-specific language can be
performed. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a static analysis for a DSL can be
externalized and reused in another general purpose language.
  Grounding: The approach was evaluated using the RAG system JastAdd. To
illustrate reusability, we implemented two analyses with two addressed
languages each: a cycle detection analysis used in a small state machine DSL
and for detecting circular dependencies in Java types and packages, and an
analysis of variable shadowing, applied to both Java and the Modelica modelling
language. Thereby, we demonstrate the reuse of two analysis algorithms in three
completely different domains. Additionally, we use the cycle detection analysis
to evaluate the efficiency by comparing our external analysis to an internal
reference implementation analysing all Java programs in the Qualitas Corpus and
thereby are able to show that an externalized analysis incurs only minimal
overhead.
  Importance: We make static analysis reusable, again, showing the practicality
and efficiency of externalizing static analysis for both DSLs and general
purpose languages using relational RAGs.",Johannes Mey

investigate the dynamic behaviour of the passive coupling of adjacent
structures. However, few papers have used optimization techniques with
guaranteed convergence in order to increase the efficiency of the passive
coupling of adjacent structures. In this paper, the combined problem of optimal
arrangement and mechanical properties of dampers placed between two adjacent
buildings is considered. A new bi-level optimization approach is presented. The
outer-loop of the approach optimizes damper configuration and is solved using
the ``inserting dampers'' method, which was recently shown to be a very
effective heuristic method. Under the assumption that the dampers have varying
damper coefficients, the inner-loop finds the optimal damper coefficients by
solving an $n$-dimensional optimization problem, where derivative information
of the objective function is not available. Three different non-gradient
methods are compared for solving the inner loop: a genetic algorithm (GA), the
mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithm, and the robust approximate
gradient sampling (RAGS) algorithm. It is shown that by exploiting this new
bi-level problem formulation, modern derivative free optimization techniques
with guaranteed convergence (such as MADS and RAGS) can be used. The results
indicate a great increase in the efficiency of the retrofitting system, as well

  Rubber","When a thermoset polymer is cured at elevated temperature in a closed mold,
thermal expansion can produce flaws in the finished product. Those flaws occur
when rising internal pressure pushes the mold open and cured polymer flows out
through gaps at the parting lines. Known as backrind, such defects are
particularly common in compression molding, where the increasing pressure of a
trapped, incompressible polymer can overwhelm the clamping pressure on the mold
and expel polymer from the mold pocket. If that ejected material has already
cured, it leaves behind structural damage and consequently a flaw in the
finished product.
  Backrind usually appears as a ragged seam line near the gap where cured
polymer exited the mold. Its appearance is typically irregular and fragmented,
suggesting no particular pattern or uniformity to the process that produced it.
In such cases, the cured polymer acts predominantly as a viscoelastic solid as
it is driven toward and through the parting line. The backrind's ragged
character results from tearing and fragmentation of that solid.
  It is possible, however, for the cured polymer to act predominantly as a
viscoelastic liquid as it flows toward and through the parting line. Since the
Reynolds number is low, the flow is laminar and the backrind bears witness to
that laminar flow. More specifically, the backrind's observed shaped
corresponds to isochronous contours in the laminar flow toward the parting
line, contours that can be predicted using computational fluid dynamics.",Louis A. Bloomfield

is a very challenging problem with many practical application scenarios. For
improving reflection removal, cascaded deep models have been usually adopted to
estimate the transmission in a progressive manner. However, most existing
methods are still limited in exploiting the result in prior stage for guiding
transmission estimation. In this paper, we present a novel two-stage network
with reflection-aware guidance (RAGNet) for single image reflection removal

it generally is much simpler and is relatively easier to estimate.
Reflectionaware guidance (RAG) module is then elaborated for better exploiting

feature maps from the estimated reflection and observation, RAG can be used (i)
to mitigate the effect of reflection from the observation, and (ii) to generate
mask in partial convolution for mitigating the effect of deviating from linear
combination hypothesis. A dedicated mask loss is further presented for
reconciling the contributions of encoder and decoder features. Experiments on

many bus operation applications, such as timetable scheduling, travel time
forecasting and transit service assessment/improvement. Most previous studies
rely on either independent assumptions or simplified local spatial correlation
structures. In the real world, however, link travel time on a bus route could
exhibit complex correlation structures, such as long-range correlations,
negative correlations, and time-varying correlations. Therefore, before
introducing strong assumptions, it is essential to empirically quantify and
examine the correlation structure of link travel time from real-world bus
operation data. To this end, this paper develops a Bayesian Gaussian model to
estimate the link travel time correlation matrix of a bus route using
smart-card-like data. Our method overcomes the small-sample-size problem in
correlation matrix estimation by borrowing/integrating those incomplete
observations (i.e., with missing/ragged values and overlapped link segments)
from other bus routes. Next, we propose an efficient Gibbs sampling framework
to marginalize over the missing and ragged values and obtain the posterior
distribution of the correlation matrix. Three numerical experiments are
conducted to evaluate model performance. We first conduct a synthetic
experiment and our results show that the proposed method produces an accurate
estimation for travel time correlations with credible intervals. Next, we
perform experiments on a real-world bus route with smart card data; our results
show that both local and long-range correlations exist on this bus route.
Finally, we demonstrate an application of using the estimated covariance matrix
to make probabilistic forecasting of link and trip travel time.",Xiaoxu Chen

pipeline, and corresponding metrics. Extensive experiments with seven LLMs
reveal their varying behaviors. And, with role play intervention, we can change
the styles, but different models present distinct adaptivity and upper-bound.
One of our key takeaways is to optimize models or the prompts according to the

dynamically adjust the interventions according to the quality of retrieval
results -- being dependent to better leverage informative context; and, being
intuitive when external prompt is noisy.",Jiahao Ying

often prone to challenges such as integrating dynamic event information,
writing fine-grained queries, and closing information gaps. This motivates the
development of a system that retrieves and represents critical aspects of
events in a form that aids in automatic generation of intelligence reports.
  We introduce a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to augment
prompting of an autoregressive decoder by retrieving structured information
asserted in a knowledge graph to generate targeted information based on a
narrative plot model. We apply our approach to the problem of neural
intelligence report generation and introduce FABULA, framework to augment
intelligence analysis workflows using RAG. An analyst can use FABULA to query
an Event Plot Graph (EPG) to retrieve relevant event plot points, which can be
used to augment prompting of a Large Language Model (LLM) during intelligence
report generation. Our evaluation studies show that the plot points included in
the generated intelligence reports have high semantic relevance, high

In this paper, we propose an Induction-Augmented Generation (IAG) framework

On top of this, we implement two versions of IAG named IAG-GPT and IAG-Student,

answer prediction, while IAG-Student gets rid of dependencies on GPT service at
inference time by incorporating a student inductor model. The inductor is
firstly trained via knowledge distillation and further optimized by
back-propagating the generator feedback via differentiable beam scores.
Experimental results show that IAG outperforms RAG baselines as well as ChatGPT

  Models","Unstructured data formats account for over 80% of the data currently stored,
and extracting value from such formats remains a considerable challenge. In
particular, current approaches for managing unstructured documents do not
support ad-hoc analytical queries on document collections. Moreover, Large
Language Models (LLMs) directly applied to the documents themselves, or on
portions of documents through a process of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), fail to provide high accuracy query results, and in the LLM-only case,
additionally incur high costs. Since many unstructured documents in a
collection often follow similar templates that impart a common semantic
structure, we introduce ZenDB, a document analytics system that leverages this
semantic structure, coupled with LLMs, to answer ad-hoc SQL queries on document
collections. ZenDB efficiently extracts semantic hierarchical structures from
such templatized documents, and introduces a novel query engine that leverages
these structures for accurate and cost-effective query execution. Users can
impose a schema on their documents, and query it, all via SQL. Extensive
experiments on three real-world document collections demonstrate ZenDB's
benefits, achieving up to 30% cost savings compared to LLM-based baselines,

CoA processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and it
mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context. We

have recently been shown to be vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks in which
a malicious user injects a small fraction of adversarial passages into the
retrieval corpus to trick the system into returning these passages among the
top-ranked results for a broad set of user queries. Further study is needed to
understand the extent to which these attacks could limit the deployment of
dense retrievers in real-world applications. In this work, we propose
Approximate Greedy Gradient Descent (AGGD), a new attack on dense retrieval

sampling with a more structured search. Experimentally, we show that our method
achieves a high attack success rate on several datasets and using several

method is extremely effective in attacking the ANCE retrieval model, achieving
attack success rates that are 15.24\% and 17.44\% higher on the NQ and MS MARCO

The common retrievers like DPR normally work with 100-word Wikipedia
paragraphs. Such a design forces the retriever to search over a large corpus to
find the `needle' unit. In contrast, the readers only need to generate answers
from the short retrieved units. The imbalanced `heavy' retriever and `light'
reader design can lead to sub-optimal performance. The loss of contextual
information in the short, chunked units may increase the likelihood of
introducing hard negatives during the retrieval stage. Additionally, the reader
might not fully leverage the capabilities of recent advancements in LLMs. In
order to alleviate the imbalance, we propose a new framework LongRAG,
consisting of a `long retriever' and a `long reader'. In the two
Wikipedia-based datasets, NQ and HotpotQA, LongRAG processes the entire
Wikipedia corpus into 4K-token units by grouping related documents. By
increasing the unit size, we significantly reduce the total number of units.
This greatly reduces the burden on the retriever, resulting in strong retrieval
performance with only a few (less than 8) top units. Without requiring any
training, LongRAG achieves an EM of 62.7% on NQ and 64.3% on HotpotQA, which
are on par with the (fully-trained) SoTA model. Furthermore, we test on two
non-Wikipedia-based datasets, Qasper and MultiFieldQA-en. LongRAG processes
each individual document as a single (long) unit rather than chunking them into
smaller units. By doing so, we achieve an F1 score of 25.9% on Qasper and 57.5%

  Forecasting","Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in
various data mining tasks, such as knowledge question answering, mathematical
reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. However, the reasoning capability of LLMs
on temporal event forecasting has been under-explored. To systematically
investigate their abilities in temporal event forecasting, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based methods for temporal event forecasting.
Due to the lack of a high-quality dataset that involves both graph and textual
data, we first construct a benchmark dataset, named MidEast-TE-mini. Based on
this dataset, we design a series of baseline methods, characterized by various
input formats and retrieval augmented generation(RAG) modules. From extensive
experiments, we find that directly integrating raw texts into the input of LLMs
does not enhance zero-shot extrapolation performance. In contrast,
incorporating raw texts in specific complex events and fine-tuning LLMs
significantly improves performance. Moreover, enhanced with retrieval modules,
LLM can effectively capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical
events. Meanwhile, issues such as popularity bias and the long-tail problem
still persist in LLMs, particularly in the RAG-based method. These findings not
only deepen our understanding of LLM-based event forecasting methods but also
highlight several promising research directions.We consider that this

citation accuracy and recall. This suggests that current open-source LCMs are
prone to responding based on their inherent knowledge rather than the given
context, posing a significant risk to the user experience in practical
applications. We also evaluate the RAG approach and observe that RAG can
significantly improve the faithfulness of LCMs, albeit with a slight decrease
in the generation quality. Furthermore, we discover a correlation between the

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A Pilot Study in Semantic and
  Contextual Search for Customized Literature Characterization for High-Impact
  Urban Research","Bibliometric analysis is essential for understanding research trends, scope,
and impact in urban science, especially in high-impact journals, such Nature
Portfolios. However, traditional methods, relying on keyword searches and basic
NLP techniques, often fail to uncover valuable insights not explicitly stated
in article titles or keywords. These approaches are unable to perform semantic
searches and contextual understanding, limiting their effectiveness in
classifying topics and characterizing studies. In this paper, we address these
limitations by leveraging Generative AI models, specifically transformers and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to automate and enhance bibliometric
analysis. We developed a technical workflow that integrates a vector database,
Sentence Transformers, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Retrieval Agent, and
Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable contextual search, topic ranking, and
characterization of research using customized prompt templates. A pilot study
analyzing 223 urban science-related articles published in Nature Communications
over the past decade highlights the effectiveness of our approach in generating
insightful summary statistics on the quality, scope, and characteristics of

  Operations on Massive Textual Data","The rapid increase in textual information means we need more efficient
methods to sift through, organize, and understand it all. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models excel in accessing information from
large document collections, they struggle with complex tasks that require
aggregation and reasoning over information spanning across multiple
documents--what we call holistic reasoning. Long-context language models
(LCLMs) have great potential for managing large-scale documents, but their
holistic reasoning capabilities remain unclear. In this work, we introduce
HoloBench, a novel framework that brings database reasoning operations into
text-based contexts, making it easier to systematically evaluate how LCLMs
handle holistic reasoning across large documents. Our approach adjusts key
factors such as context length, information density, distribution of
information, and query complexity to evaluate LCLMs comprehensively. Our
experiments show that the amount of information in the context has a bigger
influence on LCLM performance than the actual context length. Furthermore, the
complexity of queries affects performance more than the amount of information,
particularly for different types of queries. Interestingly, queries that
involve finding maximum or minimum values are easier for LCLMs and are less
affected by context length, even though they pose challenges for RAG systems.
However, tasks requiring the aggregation of multiple pieces of information show
a noticeable drop in accuracy as context length increases. Additionally, we
find that while grouping relevant information generally improves performance,
the optimal positioning varies across models. Our findings surface both the
advancements and the ongoing challenges in achieving a holistic understanding
of long contexts.",Seiji Maekawa

  Perception","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while serving as a viable complement to
large language models (LLMs), often overlooks the crucial aspect of text
chunking within its pipeline, which impacts the quality of knowledge-intensive
tasks. This paper introduces the concept of Meta-Chunking, which refers to a
granularity between sentences and paragraphs, consisting of a collection of
sentences within a paragraph that have deep linguistic logical connections. To
implement Meta-Chunking, we designed Perplexity (PPL) Chunking, which balances
performance and speed, and precisely identifies the boundaries of text chunks
by analyzing the characteristics of context perplexity distribution.
Additionally, considering the inherent complexity of different texts, we
propose a strategy that combines PPL Chunking with dynamic merging to achieve a
balance between fine-grained and coarse-grained text chunking. Experiments
conducted on eleven datasets demonstrate that Meta-Chunking can more
efficiently improve the performance of single-hop and multi-hop question
answering based on RAG. For instance, on the 2WikiMultihopQA dataset, it
outperforms similarity chunking by 1.32 while only consuming 45.8% of the time.
Furthermore, through the analysis of models of various scales and types, we
observed that PPL Chunking exhibits notable flexibility and adaptability. Our

Models (LLMs) recently showing significant potential. Moreover, in the context
of unit test generation, these tools prioritize high code coverage, often at
the expense of practical usability, correctness, and maintainability. In
response, we propose Property-Based Retrieval Augmentation, a novel mechanism
that extends LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) beyond basic
vector, text similarity, and graph-based methods. Our approach considers
task-specific context and introduces a tailored property retrieval mechanism.
Specifically, in the unit test generation task, we account for the unique
structure of unit tests by dividing the test generation process into Given,
When, and Then phases. When generating tests for a focal method, we not only
retrieve general context for the code under test but also consider
task-specific context such as pre-existing tests of other methods, which can
provide valuable insights for any of the Given, When, and Then phases. This
forms property relationships between focal method and other methods, thereby
expanding the scope of retrieval beyond traditional RAG. We implement this
approach in a tool called APT, which sequentially performs preprocessing,
property retrieval, and unit test generation, using an iterative strategy where
newly generated tests guide the creation of subsequent ones. We evaluated APT
on 12 open-source projects with 1515 methods, and the results demonstrate that
APT consistently outperforms existing tools in terms of correctness,
completeness, and maintainability of the generated tests. Moreover, we
introduce a novel code-context-aware retrieval mechanism for LLMs beyond
general context, offering valuable insights and potential applications for
other code-related tasks.",Zhe Zhang

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generation
capabilities but often struggle to access up-to-date information, which can
lead to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this
issue by incorporating knowledge from external databases, enabling more
accurate and relevant responses. Due to the context window constraints of LLMs,
it is impractical to input the entire external database context directly into
the model. Instead, only the most relevant information, referred to as chunks,
is selectively retrieved. However, current RAG research faces three key
challenges. First, existing solutions often select each chunk independently,
overlooking potential correlations among them. Second, in practice the utility
of chunks is non-monotonic, meaning that adding more chunks can decrease
overall utility. Traditional methods emphasize maximizing the number of
included chunks, which can inadvertently compromise performance. Third, each
type of user query possesses unique characteristics that require tailored
handling, an aspect that current approaches do not fully consider. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a cost constrained retrieval optimization system
CORAG for retrieval-augmented generation. We employ a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) based policy framework to find optimal chunk combinations sequentially,
allowing for a comprehensive consideration of correlations among chunks.
Additionally, rather than viewing budget exhaustion as a termination condition,
we integrate budget constraints into the optimization of chunk combinations,

proposed method's effectiveness in maintenance tasks, a maintenance scheme

results show that the accuracy of the maintenance schemes generated by the

proprietary LLMs (Gemini, GPT, Claude) excel at answering queries when the
context is sufficient, but often output incorrect answers instead of abstaining
when the context is not. On the other hand, open-source LLMs (Llama, Mistral,
Gemma) hallucinate or abstain often, even with sufficient context. We further
categorize cases when the context is useful, and improves accuracy, even though
it does not fully answer the query and the model errs without the context.
Building on our findings, we explore ways to reduce hallucinations in RAG

  Assimilation","Standard clothing asset generation involves creating forward-facing flat-lay
garment images displayed on a clear background by extracting clothing
information from diverse real-world contexts, which presents significant
challenges due to highly standardized sampling distributions and precise
structural requirements in the generated images. Existing models have limited
spatial perception and often exhibit structural hallucinations in this
high-specification generative task. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, termed RAGDiffusion, to enhance
structure determinacy and mitigate hallucinations by assimilating external
knowledge from LLM and databases. RAGDiffusion consists of two core processes:
(1) Retrieval-based structure aggregation, which employs contrastive learning
and a Structure Locally Linear Embedding (SLLE) to derive global structure and
spatial landmarks, providing both soft and hard guidance to counteract
structural ambiguities; and (2) Omni-level faithful garment generation, which
introduces a three-level alignment that ensures fidelity in structural,
pattern, and decoding components within the diffusing. Extensive experiments on
challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGDiffusion synthesizes
structurally and detail-faithful clothing assets with significant performance
improvements, representing a pioneering effort in high-specification faithful

information and solutions to the specific needs of University of Milano-Bicocca
(Unimib) students through a question-answering approach. We provided the system
with a prompt highlighting its specific purpose and behavior, as well as
university-related documents and links obtained from an initial need-finding
phase, interviewing six students. After a preliminary customization phase, a
qualitative usability test was conducted with six other students to identify
the strengths and weaknesses of the chatbot, with the goal of improving it in a
subsequent redesign phase. While the chatbot was appreciated for its
user-friendly experience, perceived general reliability, well-structured

experience of the users was impaired by the system's inability to always
provide fully accurate information. Moreover, it would often neglect to report
relevant information even if present in the materials uploaded and prompt

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Unlike conventional retrieval
approaches that utilize generic embeddings agnostic to the downstream task, our
strategy aligns the retrieval model directly with the objective of maximizing
translation quality, as quantified by the CodeBLEU metric. This alignment
ensures that the embeddings are semantically and syntactically meaningful for
the specific code translation task. Our methodology involves constructing a
dataset of 25,000 Fortran code snippets sourced from Stack-V2 dataset and
generating their corresponding C++ translations using the LLaMA 3.1-8B language
model. We compute pairwise CodeBLEU scores between the generated translations
and ground truth examples to capture fine-grained similarities. These scores
serve as supervision signals in a contrastive learning framework, where we
optimize the embedding model to retrieve Fortran-C++ pairs that are most
beneficial for improving the language model's translation performance. By
integrating these CodeBLEU-optimized embeddings into the RAG framework, our
approach significantly enhances both retrieval accuracy and code generation
quality over methods employing generic embeddings. On the HPC Fortran2C++
dataset, our method elevates the average CodeBLEU score from 0.64 to 0.73,
achieving a 14% relative improvement. On the Numerical Recipes dataset, we
observe an increase from 0.52 to 0.60, marking a 15% relative improvement.
Importantly, these gains are realized without any fine-tuning of the language
model, underscoring the efficiency and practicality of our approach.",Manish Bhattarai

the relatedness side, SiReRAG extracts propositions and entities from texts,
groups propositions via shared entities, and generates recursive summaries to
construct a relatedness tree. We index and flatten both similarity and
relatedness trees into a unified retrieval pool. Our experiments demonstrate
that SiReRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods on
three multihop datasets (MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA), with an

i\gam_5\psi\rag$ form static space dependent configurations because of
non-trivial dynamics. These configurations may be viewed as one dimensional
chiral bags that trap the original fermions (``quarks"") into stable extended
entities (``hadrons""). We provide explicit expressions for the profiles of
these objects and calculate their masses. Our analysis of these saddle points
is based on an explicit representation we find for the diagonal resolvent of
the Dirac operator in a $\{\sigx, \pix\}$ background which produces a
prescribed number of bound states. We analyse in detail the cases of a single
as well as two bound states. We find that bags that trap $N$ fermions are the
most stable ones, because they release all the fermion rest mass as binding
energy and become massless. Our explicit construction of the diagonal resolvent
is based on elementary Sturm-Liouville theory and simple dimensional analysis
and does not depend on the large $N$ approximation. These facts make it, in our
view, simpler and more direct than the calculations previously done by Shei,

promotes the design of large multi-modal models (LMMs) fostered by three key
capabilities: 1) processing of multi-modal sensing data, 2) grounding of
physical symbol representations in real-world wireless systems using causal
reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and 3) enabling
instructibility from the wireless environment feedback to facilitate dynamic
network adaptation thanks to logical and mathematical reasoning facilitated by

networking tasks and alignment of intents across different domains. Preliminary
results from experimental evaluation demonstrate the efficacy of grounding
using RAG in LMMs, and showcase the alignment of LMMs with wireless system
designs. Furthermore, the enhanced rationale exhibited in the responses to
mathematical questions by LMMs, compared to vanilla LLMs, demonstrates the

response, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a highly
promising paradigm to improve LLM outputs by grounding them in factual
information. RAG relies on textual entailment (TE) or similar methods to check
if the text produced by LLMs is supported or contradicted, compared to
retrieved documents. This paper argues that conventional TE methods are
inadequate for spotting hallucinations in content generated by LLMs. For
instance, consider a prompt about the 'USA's stance on the Ukraine war''. The
AI-generated text states, ...U.S. President Barack Obama says the U.S. will not
put troops in Ukraine...'' However, during the war the U.S. president is Joe
Biden which contradicts factual reality. Moreover, current TE systems are
unable to accurately annotate the given text and identify the exact portion
that is contradicted. To address this, we introduces a new type of TE called
``Factual Entailment (FE).'', aims to detect factual inaccuracies in content
generated by LLMs while also highlighting the specific text segment that
contradicts reality. We present FACTOID (FACTual enTAILment for hallucInation

  Aim. Our empirical study aims to investigate the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned LLM in risk analysis. To our
knowledge, no prior study has explored its capabilities in risk analysis.
  Method. We manually curated 193 unique scenarios leading to 1283
representative samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the

clinical decision-making simulations. Large Language Models (LLM) could advance
simulated patient systems by replicating medical conditions and patient-doctor
interactions with high fidelity and low cost. However, ensuring the
effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems remains a challenge, as they
require a large, diverse, and precise patient knowledgebase, along with a
robust and stable knowledge diffusion to users. Here, we developed AIPatient,
an advanced simulated patient system with AIPatient Knowledge Graph (AIPatient
KG) as the input and the Reasoning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Reasoning
RAG) agentic workflow as the generation backbone. AIPatient KG samples data
from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the Medical Information Mart for
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database, producing a clinically diverse and
relevant cohort of 1,495 patients with high knowledgebase validity (F1 0.89).
Reasoning RAG leverages six LLM powered agents spanning tasks including
retrieval, KG query generation, abstraction, checker, rewrite, and
summarization. This agentic framework reaches an overall accuracy of 94.15% in
EHR-based medical Question Answering (QA), outperforming benchmarks that use
either no agent or only partial agent integration. Our system also presents
high readability (median Flesch Reading Ease 77.23; median Flesch Kincaid Grade
5.6), robustness (ANOVA F-value 0.6126, p>0.1), and stability (ANOVA F-value

  NGC 4258","Observations of line emission from water masers near the center of the galaxy
NGC 4258 have recently provided compelling evidence for rotating disk of gas,
viewed nearly edge-on, surrounding a massive black hole (Miyoshi etal. 1995).
  We show that the disk is only marginally stable to radial perturbations - a
stability regime where weak non-axisymmetric disturbances tend to grow via the
swing amplification effect, forming a ragged, multi-armed spiral pattern
similar to that observed in Sc galaxies.
  This suggests a natural explanation for the apparent clustering of the
high-velocity emission sources into several distinct clumps, and for the
observed regularity in the distance intervals between them. The clumps of
sources appear at the intersections of the spiral arms and the radial line of
longest coherent gain path, and are thus spaced apart at the characteristic
crest-to-crest radial distance between the arms. This interpretation implies an
H_2 density and disk thickness of about 1.8x10^{10} (Q/1.6)^{-1} cm^{-3}, and
0.003(Q/1.6) pc at a radius of 0.2 pc, respectively, where the local value of

SNR's shell is similar to that of the well-known SNR VRO 42.05.01 and that the
observed bright arc corresponds to the ""half"" of the SNR located inside the

of the thermalized wind, and the steady filtering of the shocked wind gas
through channels carved within the cloud stratum that results into the creation
of large-scale superbubbles. Both solutions are here claimed to be concurrently

  using Retrieval Augmented Generation","Summarization of electronic health records (EHRs) can substantially minimize
'screen time' for both patients as well as medical personnel. In recent years
summarization of EHRs have employed machine learning pipelines using state of
the art neural models. However, these models have produced less than adequate
results that are attributed to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient annotated
data for training. Moreover, the requirement to consider the entire content of
an EHR in summarization has resulted in poor performance due to the fact that
attention mechanisms in modern large language models (LLMs) adds a quadratic
complexity in terms of the size of the input. We propose here a method that
mitigates these shortcomings by combining semantic search, retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) and question-answering using the latest LLMs. In our approach
summarization is the extraction of answers to specific questions that are
deemed important by subject-matter experts (SMEs). Our approach is quite
efficient; requires minimal to no training; does not suffer from the
'hallucination' problem of LLMs; and it ensures diversity, since the summary

comprehending the model's outputs through conversational means increases. Most
recently, foundation models are being explored for their potential as post hoc
explainers, providing a pathway to elucidate the decision-making mechanisms of
predictive models. In this work, we introduce traceable question-answering,
leveraging an external knowledge repository to inform the responses of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to user queries within a scene understanding task. This
knowledge repository comprises contextual details regarding the model's output,
containing high-level features, feature importance, and alternative
probabilities. We employ subtractive counterfactual reasoning to compute
feature importance, a method that entails analysing output variations resulting
from decomposing semantic features. Furthermore, to maintain a seamless
conversational flow, we integrate four key characteristics - social, causal,
selective, and contrastive - drawn from social science research on human
explanations into a single-shot prompt, guiding the response generation
process. Our evaluation demonstrates that explanations generated by the LLMs
encompassed these elements, indicating its potential to bridge the gap between
complex model outputs and natural language expressions.",Sule Tekkesinoglu

  Models","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised natural language processing
tasks, particularly as chat agents. However, their applicability to threat
detection problems remains unclear. This paper examines the feasibility of
employing LLMs as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), despite their
high computational requirements, primarily for the sake of explainability.
Furthermore, considerable resources have been invested in developing LLMs, and
they may offer utility for NIDS. Current state-of-the-art NIDS rely on
artificial benchmarking datasets, resulting in skewed performance when applied
to real-world networking environments. Therefore, we compare the GPT-4 and
LLama3 models against traditional architectures and transformer-based models to
assess their ability to detect malicious NetFlows without depending on
artificially skewed datasets, but solely on their vast pre-trained acquired
knowledge. Our results reveal that, although LLMs struggle with precise attack
detection, they hold significant potential for a path towards explainable NIDS.
Our preliminary exploration shows that LLMs are unfit for the detection of
Malicious NetFlows. Most promisingly, however, these exhibit significant
potential as complementary agents in NIDS, particularly in providing
explanations and aiding in threat response when integrated with Retrieval

to sudden generalization on test set long after the model fit to the training

of the number of tokens trained, similarly to how grokking speed is unaffected
by dataset size as long as the data distribution is preserved. (3) Induction
heads, the attention heads responsible for copying, form from shallow to deep

  Attribution","To assist humans in efficiently validating RAG-generated content, developing
a fine-grained attribution mechanism that provides supporting evidence from
retrieved documents for every answer span is essential. Existing fine-grained
attribution methods rely on model-internal similarity metrics between responses
and documents, such as saliency scores and hidden state similarity. However,
these approaches suffer from either high computational complexity or
coarse-grained representations. Additionally, a common problem shared by the
previous works is their reliance on decoder-only Transformers, limiting their
ability to incorporate contextual information after the target span. To address
the above problems, we propose two techniques applicable to all
model-internals-based methods. First, we aggregate token-wise evidence through
set union operations, preserving the granularity of representations. Second, we
enhance the attributor by integrating dependency parsing to enrich the semantic
completeness of target spans. For practical implementation, our approach
employs attention weights as the similarity metric. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms all prior works.",Qiang Ding

fine-grained evidence from the corpus with constrained decoding. Moreover, to
mitigate false pruning in the process of constrained evidence generation, we
introduce (1) hierarchical FM-Index constraints, which generate
corpus-constrained clues to identify a subset of relevant documents before
evidence generation, reducing irrelevant decoding space; and (2) a
forward-looking constrained decoding strategy, which considers the relevance of
future sequences to improve evidence accuracy. Extensive experiments on five

semiempirical theory by Lin and Shu was confronted with serious problems. They
were put on the defensive over their tightly wrapped steady modes on two
principal fronts: from the radial propagation at the group velocity that would
tend to wind them almost at the material rate, and from the tendencies of
galaxy disks toward a strong global instability that appeared likely to
overwhelm them. Of course, one might claim that such threats were imaginary and
only of academic interest, on the ground that nature itself had overcome them.
One might also be confident that the QSSS hypothesis must be correct as
illuminated by the everlasting truth of Hubble's classification. One might even
take pride in the fact that a very promising concept developed, although not
connected to the wave steadiness, on spiral shocks in interstellar gas and
their induced star formation. But such a heuristic approach did not stimulate
very strong progress in understanding dynamical principles of the spiral
phenomenon; moreover, it often misled, and a rich irony was already that the
supposed QSSS favorites M51 and M81 turned out most probably not to be
quasi-steady at all. A further irony was the continuing failure of Lin and Shu
to account the trailing character of their 'modes', while that was already
grasped by their direct 'deductive' opponents. But the greatest irony lay in
the fact that the concept later known as swing amplification, worked out by the
mid-1960s, was originally denigrated by Lin's camp as relating exclusively to
'material arms', whereas it turned out in the end to be of vital importance to
this entire spiral enterprise including the variants of chaotic ragged

sequence that accounts for their observed detailed structure. The model assumes
a massive and young stellar cluster surrounded by a large collection of clouds.
These are thus exposed to the most important star-formation feedback
mechanisms: photoionization and the cluster wind. The models show how the two
feedback mechanisms compete in the disruption of clouds and lead to two
different hydrodynamic solutions: The storage of clouds into a long lasting
ragged shell that inhibits the expansion of the thermalized wind, and the
steady filtering of the shocked wind gas through channels carved within the
cloud stratum. Both solutions are claimed to be concurrently at work in giant
HII regions and HII galaxies, causing their detailed inner structure. This
includes multiple large-scale shells, filled with an X-ray emitting gas, that
evolve to finally merge with each other, giving the appearance of shells within
shells. The models also show how the inner filamentary structure of the giant
superbubbles is largely enhanced with matter ablated from clouds and how cloud
ablation proceeds within the original cloud stratum. The calculations point at
the initial contrast density between the cloud and the intercloud media as the
factor that defines which of the two feedback mechanisms becomes dominant
throughout the evolution. Animated version of the models can be found at

~40% weaker and 10% to 15% narrower. There is no evidence for acceleration or
for any outflow gas at velocities <23,000 km/s. The lines appear to be
optically thick, with the absorber covering just 20% of the quasar continuum
source. This indicates a characteristic absorber size of ~4 x 10^15 cm, but
with a BAL-like total column density log N_H (cm^-2) > 21.2 and average space
density n_H > 2 x 10^5 cm^-3. We attribute the emergence of the outflow lines

only when the relative velocity of the two fluids is nonrelativistic, a
difference of the enthalpy densities of the two fluids is much smaller than the

meshes and dynamic point clouds, can take advantage of temporal redundancy for
compression, if certain challenges are addressed. In this paper, we propose
methods for compressing both static and dynamic polygon clouds, specifically
triangle clouds. We compare triangle clouds to both triangle meshes and point
clouds in terms of compression, for live captured dynamic colored geometry. We
find that triangle clouds can be compressed nearly as well as triangle meshes,
while being far more robust to noise and other structures typically found in
live captures, which violate the assumption of a smooth surface manifold, such
as lines, points, and ragged boundaries. We also find that triangle clouds can
be used to compress point clouds with significantly better performance than
previously demonstrated point cloud compression methods. In particular, for
intra-frame coding of geometry, our method improves upon octree-based
intra-frame coding by a factor of 5-10 in bit rate. Inter-frame coding improves

  When assigning values to some variables in a function $f$ the resulting
function is a subfunction of $f$, and when identifying some variables the
resulting function is a minor of $f$. A set $M$ of essential variables in $f$
is separable if there is a subfunction of $f$, whose set of essential variables

distinct essential variables in $f$. We prove that, if a function $f$ has
non-trivial arity gap ($gap(f)\ge 2$), then all sets of essential variables in
$f$ are separable. We define equivalence relations which classify the functions
of $k$-valued logic into classes with the same minor complexities. These
relations induce transformation groups which are compared with the subgroups of

virial radius using a large sample of halos drawn from Illustris, along with a
set of zoom simulations (MUGS). Using these, we make a systematic exploration
of the shape profile beyond R$_{vir}$. In the mean sphericity profile of
Illustris halos we identify a dip close to the virial radius, which is robust
across a broad range of masses and infall rates. The inner edge of this feature
may be related to the virial radius and the outer edge with the splashback
radius. Due to the high halo-to-halo variation this result is visible only on
average. However, in four individual halos in the MUGS sample, a decrease in
the sphericity and a subsequent recovery is evident close to the splashback
radius. We find that this feature persists for several Gyr, growing with the
halo. This feature appears at the interface between the spherical halo density
distribution and the filamentary structure in the environment. The shape
feature is strongest when there is a high rate of infall, implying that the
effect is due to the mixing of accreting and virializing material. The
filamentary velocity field becomes rapidly mixed in the halo region inside the
virial radius, with the area between this and the splashback radius serving as
the transition region. We also identify a long-lasting and smoothly evolving
splashback region in the radial density gradient in many of the MUGS halos.",O. N. Snaith

However, at higher temperatures ($\stackrel{>}{_\sim}26$ K) the geometry
changes dramatically, showing a bubble boundary which is accurately circular in

with Spitzer 8 $\mu$m data suggests that the $\sim26$-30 K dust seen by
Herschel resides in the photodissociation region (PDR) surrounding the HII
region. Its projected radial profile is consistent with that of a spherical
shell, thus arguing against previous suggestions of cylindrical or planar
geometry. The inferred geometry is, in fact, consistent with previous
interpretations of the HII region as a classical Str\""omgren sphere, except for
the fact that the ionising star (CD -38.11636; O8V) is displaced by more than
half a radius from its geometric centre. None of the previously published
models has satisfactorily accounted for that displacement. It could, however,
be explained by proper motion of the O star at $\sim2$-4 km s$^{-1}$ since its
formation, possibly due to a cloud-cloud collision. We suggest that the current
spherical bubble constitutes the fossilised remnant of the initial expansion of
the HII region following the formation of the star, which now continues to flee

oscillations of classical pulsators. The resulting dynamics are modelled by a
driven damped harmonic oscillator subject to either an external or an internal
forcing and white noise velocity fluctuations. We characterize the phase and
relative amplitude variations using analytical and numerical tools. When the
forcing is internal the phase variation displays a random walk behaviour and a
red noise power spectrum with a ragged erratic appearance. We determine the
dependence of the root mean square phase and relative amplitude variations
($\sigma_{\Delta \varphi}$ and $\sigma_{\Delta A/A}$, respectively) on the
amplitude of the stochastic perturbations, the damping constant $\eta$, and the
total observation time $t_{\rm obs}$ for this case, under the assumption that
the relative amplitude variations remain small, showing that $\sigma_{\Delta
\varphi}$ increases with $t_{\rm obs}^{1/2}$ becoming much larger than
$\sigma_{\Delta A/A}$ for $t_{\rm obs} \gg \eta^{-1}$. In the case of an
external forcing the phase and relative amplitude variations remain of the same
order, independent of the observing time. In the case of an internal forcing,
we find that $\sigma_{\Delta \varphi}$ does not depend on $\eta$. Hence, the
damping time cannot be inferred from fitting the power of the signal, as done
for solar-like pulsators, but the amplitude of the stochastic perturbations may
be constrained from the observations. Our results imply that, given sufficient
time, the variation of the phase associated to the stochastic perturbations in
internally driven classical pulsators will become sufficiently large to be

Such programs exhibit a pattern of allocating, copying, potentially mutating,
and deallocating collections of similar objects through successive generations.
These objects may assemble data structures such as stacks, queues, lists,
ragged arrays, and trees, which may be of random, and possibly unbounded, size.
For the simple case of $N$ particles, $T$ generations, $D$ objects, and
resampling at each generation, dense representation requires $O(DNT)$ memory,
while sparse representation requires only $O(DT+DN\log DN)$ memory, based on
existing theoretical results. This work describes an object copy-on-write
platform to automate this saving for the programmer. The core idea is
formalized using labeled directed multigraphs, where vertices represent
objects, edges the pointers between them, and labels the necessary bookkeeping.
A specific labeling scheme is proposed for high performance under the
motivating pattern. The platform is implemented for the Birch probabilistic
programming language, using smart pointers, hash tables, and reference-counting
garbage collection. It is tested empirically on a number of realistic
probabilistic programs, and shown to significantly reduce memory use and
execution time in a manner consistent with theoretical expectations. This
enables copy-on-write for the imperative programmer, lazy deep copies for the
object-oriented programmer, and in-place write optimizations for the functional

documents used to generate the responses are modeled as latent variables whose
prior probabilities need to be estimated. Models such as RAG and REALM,
marginalize the document probabilities over the documents retrieved from the
index to define the log likelihood loss function which is optimized end-to-end.
  In this paper, we develop a variational approach to the above technique
wherein, we instead maximize the Evidence Lower bound (ELBO). Using a
collection of three publicly available open-conversation datasets, we
demonstrate how the posterior distribution, that has information from the
ground-truth response, allows for a better approximation of the objective
function during training. To overcome the challenges associated with sampling
over a large knowledge collection, we develop an efficient approach to
approximate the ELBO. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to apply

  High Resolution Imagery Using Deep Neural Networks","Building damage detection after natural disasters like earthquakes is crucial
for initiating effective emergency response actions. Remotely sensed very high
spatial resolution (VHR) imagery can provide vital information due to their
ability to map the affected buildings with high geometric precision. Many
approaches have been developed to detect damaged buildings due to earthquakes.
However, little attention has been paid to exploiting rich features represented
in VHR images using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). This paper presents a novel
superpixel based approach combining DNN and a modified segmentation method, to
detect damaged buildings from VHR imagery. Firstly, a modified Fast Scanning
and Adaptive Merging method is extended to create initial over-segmentation.
Secondly, the segments are merged based on the Region Adjacent Graph (RAG),
considered an improved semantic similarity criterion composed of Local Binary
Patterns (LBP) texture, spectral, and shape features. Thirdly, a pre-trained
DNN using Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders called SDAE-DNN is presented, to
exploit the rich semantic features for building damage detection. Deep-layer
feature abstraction of SDAE-DNN could boost detection accuracy through learning
more intrinsic and discriminative features, which outperformed other methods
using state-of-the-art alternative classifiers. We demonstrate the feasibility

retrieval results from sources with incomparable scores, enabling an ensemble
of BM25 and neural initial retrieval. To train our system end-to-end, we
introduce a novel variation of knowledge distillation to train the initial

LLMs often invent, or ""hallucinate"", non-existent APIs or produce variants of
already existing code. This paper presents De-Hallucinator, a technique that
grounds the predictions of an LLM through a novel combination of retrieving
suitable API references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly

observation that predictions by LLMs often resemble the desired code, but they

understanding research, its limitations, and building on existing work. It is a
tedious task which makes an automatic literature review generator appealing.
Unfortunately, many existing works that generate such reviews using Large
Language Models (LLMs) have significant limitations. They tend to
hallucinate-generate non-actual information-and ignore the latest research they
have not been trained on. To address these limitations, we propose a toolkit
that operates on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) principles, specialized
prompting and instructing techniques with the help of LLMs. Our system first
initiates a web search to retrieve relevant papers by summarizing user-provided
abstracts into keywords using an off-the-shelf LLM. Authors can enhance the
search by supplementing it with relevant papers or keywords, contributing to a
tailored retrieval process. Second, the system re-ranks the retrieved papers
based on the user-provided abstract. Finally, the related work section is
generated based on the re-ranked results and the abstract. There is a
substantial reduction in time and effort for literature review compared to
traditional methods, establishing our toolkit as an efficient alternative. Our
open-source toolkit is accessible at https://github.com/shubhamagarwal92/LitLLM

pretrained foundational speech model and a large language model (LLM), while
preserving the in-context learning capability intrinsic to the pretrained LLM.
In this paper, we apply SLM to speech dialog applications where the dialog
states are inferred directly from the audio signal.
  Task-oriented dialogs often contain domain-specific entities, i.e.,
restaurants, hotels, train stations, and city names, which are difficult to
recognize, however, critical for the downstream applications. Inspired by the
RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) paradigm, we propose a retrieval augmented
SLM (ReSLM) that overcomes this weakness. We first train a speech retriever to
retrieve text entities mentioned in the audio. The retrieved entities are then
added as text inputs to the underlying SLM to bias model predictions. We
evaluated ReSLM on speech MultiWoz task (DSTC-11 challenge), and found that
this retrieval augmentation boosts model performance, achieving joint goal
accuracy (38.6% vs 32.7%), slot error rate (20.6% vs 24.8%) and ASR word error
rate (5.5% vs 6.7%). While demonstrated on dialog state tracking, our approach
is broadly applicable to other speech tasks requiring contextual information or

their responses. In this paper, we ask: do the sources that LLMs generate
actually support the claims that they make? To answer this, we propose three
contributions. First, as expert medical annotations are an expensive and
time-consuming bottleneck for scalable evaluation, we demonstrate that GPT-4 is
highly accurate in validating source relevance, agreeing 88% of the time with a
panel of medical doctors. Second, we develop an end-to-end, automated pipeline

30\% of individual statements are unsupported, while nearly half of its

  Knowledge Extraction","Large language models require updates to remain up-to-date or adapt to new
domains by fine-tuning them with new documents. One key is memorizing the
latest information in a way that the memorized information is extractable with
a query prompt. However, LLMs suffer from a phenomenon called perplexity curse;
despite minimizing document perplexity during fine-tuning, LLMs struggle to
extract information through a prompt sentence. In this new knowledge
acquisition and extraction, we find a very intriguing fact that LLMs can
accurately answer questions about the first sentence, but they struggle to
extract information described in the middle or end of the documents used for
fine-tuning. Our study suggests that the auto-regressive training causes this
issue; each token is prompted by reliance on all previous tokens, which hinders
the model from recalling information from training documents by question
prompts. To conduct the in-depth study, we publish both synthetic and real
datasets, enabling the evaluation of the QA performance w.r.t. the position of
the corresponding answer in a document. Our investigation shows that even a
large model suffers from the perplexity curse, but regularization such as
denoising auto-regressive loss can enhance the information extraction from
diverse positions. These findings will be (i) a key to improving knowledge

a critical tool when utilizing LLMs for real-world applications. However, given

modern LLMs, efficient adaptation is essential. To address these challenges, we
propose Memory of Amortized Contexts (MAC), an efficient and effective online

knowledge from this memory bank. To learn informative modulations in an
efficient manner, we utilize amortization-based meta-learning, which
substitutes an otherwise required optimization process with a single forward
pass of the encoder. Subsequently, we learn to choose from and aggregate
selected documents into a single modulation by conditioning on the question,
allowing us to adapt a frozen language model during test time without requiring
further gradient updates. Our experiment demonstrates the superiority of MAC in
multiple aspects, including online adaptation performance, time, and memory

by retrieving relevant tables and contexts of hyperlinks that are relevant to
the resulting reasoning thoughts and questions. These additional contexts are
then used to supplement the prompt used in the first step, resulting in more

poisoned data, which poses a significant security risk to LLM system
applications such as Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To address the

utilizes AI feedback to identify optimal strategies for LLMs to navigate
inter-context conflicts and context-memory conflicts with different external
evidence in context window (i.e., different ratios of poisoned factual
contexts); (2) constructs the SFT dataset as well as the preference dataset

LLM alignment to defense poisoned context attack while preserving the

For example, in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system, a retrieval
component might provide a source of ground truth, while a generative component
summarizes and augments its responses. In other systems, a large language model
(LLM) might directly generate responses without consulting a retrieval
component. While there are multiple definitions of generative information
retrieval (Gen-IR) systems, in this paper we focus on those systems where the
system's response is not drawn from a fixed collection of documents or
passages. The response to a query may be entirely new text. Since traditional
IR evaluation methods break down under this model, we explore various methods
that extend traditional offline evaluation approaches to the Gen-IR context.
Offline IR evaluation traditionally employs paid human assessors, but
increasingly LLMs are replacing human assessment, demonstrating capabilities
similar or superior to crowdsourced labels. Given that Gen-IR systems do not
generate responses from a fixed set, we assume that methods for Gen-IR
evaluation must largely depend on LLM-generated labels. Along with methods
based on binary and graded relevance, we explore methods based on explicit
subtopics, pairwise preferences, and embeddings. We first validate these
methods against human assessments on several TREC Deep Learning Track tasks; we
then apply these methods to evaluate the output of several purely generative
systems. For each method we consider both its ability to act autonomously,
without the need for human labels or other input, and its ability to support
human auditing. To trust these methods, we must be assured that their results
align with human assessments. In order to do so, evaluation criteria must be

thoroughly examine the robustness of current text-to-vis models, an area that
has not previously been explored. In particular, we construct the first
robustness dataset nvBench-Rob, which contains diverse lexical and phrasal
variations based on the original text-to-vis benchmark nvBench. Then, we found
that the performance of existing text-to-vis models on this new dataset
dramatically drops, implying that these methods exhibit inadequate robustness

NLQ-Retrieval Generator, Visualization Query-Retrieval Retuner and
Annotation-based Debugger, which are used to tackle the challenges posed by
natural language variants, programming style differences and data schema

Benchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models.
Based on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window

relevant code with a separate encoding model where the retrieved snippet serves

Backdoor attacks initially verified that LLM is doing substantial harm at all

the continuous iteration of LLMs will degrade the robustness of backdoors. In

They may easily confuse distant images with similar visual contents, or cannot

the gained robustness is frequently accompanied by a drop in generalization and
(ii) generating adversarial examples (AEs) is computationally prohibitively

that leverages the manifold conjecture, stating that off-manifold AEs lead to
better robustness while on-manifold AEs result in better generalization.
Specifically, SMAAT aims at generating a higher proportion of off-manifold AEs
by perturbing the intermediate deepnet layer with the lowest intrinsic
dimension. This systematically results in better scalability compared to
classical AT as it reduces the PGD chains length required for generating the
AEs. Additionally, our study provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first
explanation for the difference in the generalization and robustness trends
between vision and language models, ie., AT results in a drop in generalization
in vision models whereas, in encoder-based language models, generalization
either improves or remains unchanged. We show that vision transformers and
decoder-based models tend to have low intrinsic dimensionality in the earlier
layers of the network (more off-manifold AEs), while encoder-based models have
low intrinsic dimensionality in the later layers. We demonstrate the efficacy
of SMAAT; on several tasks, including robustifying (i) sentiment classifiers,

capabilities from thought structures. However, existing methods such as Tree of
Thought and Retrieval Augmented Thoughts often fall short in complex tasks due
to the limitations of insufficient local retrieval of factual knowledge and
inadequate global selection of strategies. These limitations make it
challenging for these methods to balance factual accuracy and comprehensive
logical optimization effectively. To address these limitations, we introduce
the Retrieval Augmented Thought Tree (RATT), a novel thought structure that
considers both overall logical soundness and factual correctness at each step
of the thinking process. Specifically, at every point of a thought branch, RATT
performs planning and lookahead to explore and evaluate multiple potential
reasoning steps, and integrate the fact-checking ability of Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) with LLM's ability to assess overall strategy. Through this
combination of factual knowledge and strategic feasibility, the RATT adjusts
and integrates the thought tree structure to search for the most promising
branches within the search space. This thought structure significantly enhances
the model's coherence in logical inference and efficiency in decision-making,
and thus increases the limit of the capacity of LLM to generate reliable
inferences and decisions based on thought structures. A broad range of

compression methods of LLMs, the amount of time afforded to learn, and the
difficulty levels of the target use cases. Through extensive experimentation
and benchmarking, we draw a number of surprisingly insightful guidelines for
deploying LLMs onto resource-constrained devices. For example, an optimal

we introduce the PEER (Plan, Execute, Express, Review) multi-agent framework.
This systematizes domain-specific tasks by integrating precise question

rigorous self-assessment. Given the concerns of cost and data privacy,
enterprises are shifting from proprietary models like GPT-4 to custom models,
striking a balance between cost, security, and performance. We developed
industrial practices leveraging online data and user feedback for efficient
model tuning. This study provides best practice guidelines for applying
multi-agent systems in domain-specific problem-solving and implementing
effective agent tuning strategies. Our empirical studies, particularly in the

95.0% of GPT-4's performance, while effectively managing costs and ensuring

struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain
coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels
at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales,
spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that
integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs
with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context
lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences
of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian
surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When
needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process,
combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient
and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and
InfiniteBench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance,
consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across
various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart,
RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably,
EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while
successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens - a scale
computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals
strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived
events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological
counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring
human memory mechanisms.",Zafeirios Fountas

work, we develop a stronger characterization of the optimization and
generalization landscape of ICL through contributions on architectures,
low-rank parameterization, and correlated designs: (1) We study the landscape
of 1-layer linear attention and 1-layer H3, a state-space model. Under a
suitable correlated design assumption, we prove that both implement 1-step
preconditioned gradient descent. We show that thanks to its native convolution
filters, H3 also has the advantage of implementing sample weighting and
outperforming linear attention in suitable settings. (2) By studying correlated
designs, we provide new risk bounds for retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
and task-feature alignment which reveal how ICL sample complexity benefits from
distributional alignment. (3) We derive the optimal risk for low-rank
parameterized attention weights in terms of covariance spectrum. Through this,
we also shed light on how LoRA can adapt to a new distribution by capturing the
shift between task covariances. Experimental results corroborate our
theoretical findings. Overall, this work explores the optimization and risk

  Retrieval","$k$-Nearest Neighbor search on dense vector embeddings ($k$-NN retrieval)
from pre-trained embedding models is the predominant retrieval method for text

practice, application developers often fine-tune the embeddings to improve
their accuracy on the dataset and query workload in hand. Existing approaches
either fine-tune the pre-trained model itself or, more efficiently, but at the
cost of accuracy, train adaptor models to transform the output of the
pre-trained model. We present NUDGE, a family of novel non-parametric embedding
fine-tuning approaches that are significantly more accurate and efficient than
both sets of existing approaches. NUDGE directly modifies the embeddings of
data records to maximize the accuracy of $k$-NN retrieval. We present a
thorough theoretical and experimental study of NUDGE's non-parametric approach.
We show that even though the underlying problem is NP-Hard, constrained
variations can be solved efficiently. These constraints additionally ensure
that the changes to the embeddings are modest, avoiding large distortions to
the semantics learned during pre-training. In experiments across five
pre-trained models and nine standard text and image retrieval datasets, NUDGE
runs in minutes and often improves NDCG@10 by more than 10% over existing
fine-tuning methods. On average, NUDGE provides 3.3x and 4.3x higher increase

  Large Language Models","Timeline Analysis (TA) plays a crucial role in Timeline Forensics (TF) within
the field of Digital Forensics (DF). It focuses on examining and analyzing
time-based digital artefacts, such as timestamps derived from event logs, file
metadata, and other relevant data, to correlate events linked to cyber
incidents and reconstruct their chronological sequence. Traditional tools often
struggle to efficiently handle the large volume and variety of data generated
during DF investigations and Incident Response (IR) processes. This paper
introduces a novel framework, GenDFIR, which combines Rule-Based Artificial
Intelligence (R-BAI) algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance
and automate the TA process. The proposed approach consists of two key stages:
(1) R-BAI is used to identify and select anomalous digital artefacts based on
predefined rules. (2) The selected artefacts are then transformed into
embeddings for processing by an LLM with the assistance of a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. The LLM uses its capabilities to
perform automated TA on the artefacts and predict potential incident outcomes.
To validate the framework, we evaluated its performance, efficiency, and
reliability. Several metrics were applied to simulated cyber incident
scenarios, which were presented as forensic case documents. Our findings
demonstrate the significant potential of integrating R-BAI and LLMs for TA.
This innovative approach underscores the power of Generative AI (GenAI),

progressively update the database. In each iteration, P-RAG retrieves the
latest database and obtains historical information from the previous
interaction as experiential references for the current interaction. Moreover,
we also introduce a more granular retrieval scheme that not only retrieves
similar tasks but also incorporates retrieval of similar situations to provide
more valuable reference experiences. Extensive experiments reveal that P-RAG
achieves competitive results without utilizing ground truth and can even
further improve performance through self-iterations.",Weiye Xu

Reference Trustable Decoding (RTD), a paradigm that allows models to quickly

constructs a reference datastore from the provided training examples and
optimizes the LLM's final vocabulary distribution by flexibly selecting
suitable references based on the input, resulting in more trustable responses
and enabling the model to adapt to downstream tasks at a low cost. Experimental
evaluations on various LLMs using different benchmarks demonstrate that RTD
establishes a new paradigm for augmenting models to downstream tasks.

meaningfulness of NNS. Our experiments reveal that high-dimensional text
embeddings exhibit increased resilience as dimensionality rises to higher
levels when compared to random vectors. This resilience suggests that text
embeddings are less affected to the ""curse of dimensionality,"" resulting in
more meaningful NNS outcomes for practical use. Additionally, the choice of

Then, RuAG applies Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to address the combinational
searching space and efficiently discover logic rules from data. The resulting
logic rules are translated into natural language, allowing targeted knowledge
injection and seamless integration into LLM prompts for LLM's downstream task

different alternatives that take advantage of LLMs to different extents using

  planning and chained exploration","Through training on publicly available source code libraries, large language
models (LLMs) can invoke multiple encapsulated APIs to solve complex
programming problems. However, existing models inherently cannot generalize to
use APIs that are unseen in their training corpora. As libraries continuously
evolve, it becomes impractical to exhaustively retrain LLMs with new API
knowledge. This limitation hampers LLMs from solving problems which require
newly introduced or privately maintained libraries. Human programmers often
explore unfamiliar APIs by writing experimental code before invoking them for a
more complex problem. Inspired by this behavior, we propose , a training-free
framework that empowers LLMs to invoke multiple unseen APIs in code solution by
(1) planning a complex problem into several API invocation subtasks, and (2)
exploring correct API usage through a novel chain-of-API-exploration.
Concretely, ExploraCoder guides the LLM to iteratively generate several
experimental API invocations for each simple subtask, where the promising
execution experience are exploited by subsequent subtasks. This forms a chained
exploration trace that ultimately guides LLM in generating the final solution.
We evaluate ExploraCoder on Torchdata-Github benchmark as well as a newly
constructed benchmark that involves more complex API interactions. Experimental
results demonstrate that ExploraCoder significantly improves performance for
models lacking prior API knowledge, achieving an absolute increase of 11.24%
over niave RAG approaches and 14.07% over pretraining methods in pass@10.
Moreover, the integration of a self-debug mechanism further boosts

RGC atrophy for screening glaucomatous pathologies and grading their severity.
Methods: The proposed framework encompasses a hybrid convolutional network that
extracts the retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell with the inner plexiform
layer and ganglion cell complex regions, allowing thus a quantitative screening
of glaucomatous subjects. Furthermore, the severity of glaucoma in screened
cases is objectively graded by analyzing the thickness of these regions.
Results: The proposed framework is rigorously tested on publicly available

  Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models","Recent proprietary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have achieved
a milestone in tackling diverse challenges in the biomedical domain, ranging
from multiple-choice questions to long-form generations. To address challenges
that still cannot be handled with the encoded knowledge of LLMs, various
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been developed by searching
documents from the knowledge corpus and appending them unconditionally or
selectively to the input of LLMs for generation. However, when applying
existing methods to different domain-specific problems, poor generalization
becomes apparent, leading to fetching incorrect documents or making inaccurate
judgments. In this paper, we introduce Self-BioRAG, a framework reliable for
biomedical text that specializes in generating explanations, retrieving
domain-specific documents, and self-reflecting generated responses. We utilize
84k filtered biomedical instruction sets to train Self-BioRAG that can assess
its generated explanations with customized reflective tokens. Our work proves
that domain-specific components, such as a retriever, domain-related document
corpus, and instruction sets are necessary for adhering to domain-related
instructions. Using three major medical question-answering benchmark datasets,
experimental results of Self-BioRAG demonstrate significant performance gains
by achieving a 7.2% absolute improvement on average over the state-of-the-art
open-foundation model with a parameter size of 7B or less. Overall, we analyze
that Self-BioRAG finds the clues in the question, retrieves relevant documents
if needed, and understands how to answer with information from retrieved
documents and encoded knowledge as a medical expert does. We release our data
and code for training our framework components and model weights (7B and 13B)

research community needs a diverse, accurate, and up-to-date dataset. To
address this gap, we present CyberMetric-80, CyberMetric-500, CyberMetric-2000,
and CyberMetric-10000, which are multiple-choice Q&A benchmark datasets
comprising 80, 500, 2000, and 10,000 questions respectively. By utilizing
GPT-3.5 and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we collected documents,
including NIST standards, research papers, publicly accessible books, RFCs, and
other publications in the cybersecurity domain, to generate questions, each
with four possible answers. The results underwent several rounds of error
checking and refinement. Human experts invested over 200 hours validating the
questions and solutions to ensure their accuracy and relevance, and to filter
out any questions unrelated to cybersecurity. We have evaluated and compared 25
state-of-the-art LLM models on the CyberMetric datasets. In addition to our
primary goal of evaluating LLMs, we involved 30 human participants to solve
CyberMetric-80 in a closed-book scenario. The results can serve as a reference
for comparing the general cybersecurity knowledge of humans and LLMs. The
findings revealed that GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct,
Falcon-180B-Chat, and GEMINI-pro 1.0 were the best-performing LLMs.

application of agent technology for multimodal content generation. The system
integrates multiple generative capabilities within a unified framework, so that
individual users can leverage these modules easily. This innovative system
would convert user story proposals into scripts, images, and audio, and then
integrate these multimodal contents into videos. Additionally, the animating

AesopAgent system could orchestrate task workflow for video generation,
ensuring that the generated video is both rich in content and coherent. This
system mainly contains two layers, i.e., the Horizontal Layer and the Utility

system that optimizes the whole video generation workflow and the steps within
the workflow. It continuously evolves and iteratively optimizes workflow by
accumulating expert experience and professional knowledge, including optimizing
the LLM prompts and utilities usage. The Utility Layer provides multiple
utilities, leading to consistent image generation that is visually coherent in

interoperability in digital twins and assisting the creation of Asset
Administration Shell (AAS) as digital twin model within the context of Industry
4.0. The foundational idea of our research is that the communication based on
semantics and the generation of meaningful textual data are directly linked,
and we posit that these processes are equivalent if the exchanged information
can be serialized in text form. Based on this, we construct a ""semantic node""
data structure in our research to capture the semantic essence of textual data.
Then, a system powered by large language models is designed and implemented to
process the ""semantic node"" and generate standardized digital twin models from
raw textual data collected from datasheets describing technical assets. Our
evaluation demonstrates an effective generation rate of 62-79%, indicating a
substantial proportion of the information from the source text can be
translated error-free to the target digital twin instance model with the
generative capability of large language models. This result has a direct
application in the context of Industry 4.0, and the designed system is
implemented as a data model generation tool for reducing the manual effort in
creating AAS model. In our evaluation, a comparative analysis of different LLMs

  and external evidence","Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is frequently used to mitigate
hallucinations and provide up-to-date knowledge for large language models
(LLMs). However, given that document retrieval is an imprecise task and
sometimes results in erroneous or even harmful content being presented in
context, this raises the question of how LLMs handle retrieved information: If
the provided content is incorrect, does the model know to ignore it, or does it
recapitulate the error? Conversely, when the model's initial response is
incorrect, does it always know to use the retrieved information to correct
itself, or does it insist on its wrong prior response? To answer this, we
curate a dataset of over 1200 questions across six domains (e.g., drug dosages,
Olympic records, locations) along with content relevant to answering each
question. We further apply precise perturbations to the answers in the content
that range from subtle to blatant errors. We benchmark six top-performing LLMs,
including GPT-4o, on this dataset and find that LLMs are susceptible to
adopting incorrect retrieved content, overriding their own correct prior
knowledge over 60% of the time. However, the more unrealistic the retrieved
content is (i.e. more deviated from truth), the less likely the model is to
adopt it. Also, the less confident a model is in its initial response (via
measuring token probabilities), the more likely it is to adopt the information
in the retrieved content. We exploit this finding and demonstrate simple
methods for improving model accuracy where there is conflicting retrieved
content. Our results highlight a difficult task and benchmark for LLMs --
namely, their ability to correctly discern when it is wrong in light of correct
retrieved content and to reject cases when the provided content is incorrect.",Kevin Wu

  Billion-Scale Vector Search and Breaking It with Second-Tier Memory","Vector searches on large-scale datasets are critical to modern online
services like web search and RAG, which necessity storing the datasets and
their index on the secondary storage like SSD. In this paper, we are the first
to characterize the trade-off of performance and index size in existing
SSD-based graph and cluster indexes: to improve throughput by 5.7$\times$ and
1.7$\times$, these indexes have to pay a 5.8$\times$ storage amplification and
7.7$\times$ with respect to the dataset size, respectively. The root cause is
that the coarse-grained access of SSD mismatches the fine-grained random read
required by vector indexes with small amplification.
  This paper argues that second-tier memory, such as remote DRAM/NVM connected
via RDMA or CXL, is a powerful storage for addressing the problem from a
system's perspective, thanks to its fine-grained access granularity. However,
putting existing indexes -- primarily designed for SSD -- directly on
second-tier memory cannot fully utilize its power. Meanwhile, second-tier
memory still behaves more like storage, so using it as DRAM is also
inefficient. To this end, we build a graph and cluster index that centers
around the performance features of second-tier memory. With careful execution
engine and index layout designs, we show that vector indexes can achieve
optimal performance with orders of magnitude smaller index amplification, on a
variety of second-tier memory devices.
  Based on our improved graph and vector indexes on second-tier memory, we
further conduct a systematic study between them to facilitate developers
choosing the right index for their workloads. Interestingly, the findings on
the second-tier memory contradict the ones on SSDs.",Rongxin Cheng

  Semi-open-ended Question Answering","Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for knowledge-seeking yet suffer
from hallucinations. The knowledge boundary (KB) of an LLM limits its factual
understanding, beyond which it may begin to hallucinate. Investigating the
perception of LLMs' KB is crucial for detecting hallucinations and LLMs'
reliable generation. Current studies perceive LLMs' KB on questions with a
concrete answer (close-ended questions) while paying limited attention to
semi-open-ended questions (SoeQ) that correspond to many potential answers.
Some researchers achieve it by judging whether the question is answerable or
not. However, this paradigm is unsuitable for SoeQ, which are usually partially
answerable, containing both answerable and ambiguous (unanswerable) answers.
Ambiguous answers are essential for knowledge-seeking, but they may go beyond
the KB of LLMs. In this paper, we perceive the LLMs' KB with SoeQ by
discovering more ambiguous answers. First, we apply an LLM-based approach to
construct SoeQ and obtain answers from a target LLM. Unfortunately, the output
probabilities of mainstream black-box LLMs are inaccessible to sample for
low-probability ambiguous answers. Therefore, we apply an open-sourced
auxiliary model to explore ambiguous answers for the target LLM. We calculate
the nearest semantic representation for existing answers to estimate their
probabilities, with which we reduce the generation probability of
high-probability answers to achieve a more effective generation. Finally, we
compare the results from the RAG-based evaluation and LLM self-evaluation to
categorize four types of ambiguous answers that are beyond the KB of the target
LLM. Following our method, we construct a dataset to perceive the KB for GPT-4.
We find that GPT-4 performs poorly on SoeQ and is often unaware of its KB.
Besides, our auxiliary model, LLaMA-2-13B, is effective in discovering more
ambiguous answers.",Zhihua Wen

For example, if a LVLM was released on January 2024, and it wouldn't know the
singer of the theme song for the new Detective Conan movie, which wasn't
released until April 2024. To solve the problem, a promising solution motivated
by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is to provide LVLMs with up-to-date
knowledge via internet search during inference, i.e., internet-augmented
generation (IAG), which is already integrated in some closed-source commercial
LVLMs such as GPT-4V. However, the specific mechanics underpinning them remain
a mystery. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework, for augmenting
existing LVLMs in handling visual question answering (VQA) about up-to-date

effectively and efficiently find the most helpful content from the websites
returned by a search engine to prompt LVLMs with up-to-date knowledge. To train
the model and evaluate our framework's performance, we propose a pipeline to
automatically generate news-related VQA samples to construct a dataset, dubbed

  Knowledge Fusion","Large language models (LLMs) often incorporate multiple text chunks in their
inputs to provide the necessary contexts. To speed up the prefill of the long
LLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache
when the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the
reused text chunks are not always the input prefix, and when they are not,
their precomputed KV caches cannot be directly used since they ignore the
text's cross-attention with the preceding text in the LLM input. Thus, the
benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely unrealized.
  This paper tackles just one question: when an LLM input contains multiple
text chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to
achieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e.,
without reusing KV cache)? We present CacheBlend, a scheme that reuses the
pre-computed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively recomputes
the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each reused KV
cache. In the meantime,the small extra delay for recomputing some tokens can be
pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job,allowing
CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage capacity
while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By comparing
CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on three
open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of
different tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by
2.2-3.3X and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5X, compared with full

artificial general intelligence (AGI). One opinion, especially from some
startups working on LLMs, argues that an LLM with nearly unlimited context
length can realize AGI. However, they might be too optimistic about the
long-context capability of (existing) LLMs -- (1) Recent literature has shown
that their effective context length is significantly smaller than their claimed
context length; and (2) Our reasoning-in-a-haystack experiments further
demonstrate that simultaneously finding the relevant information from a long
context and conducting (simple) reasoning is nearly impossible. In this paper,
we envision a pathway from LLMs to AGI through the integration of
\emph{memory}. We believe that AGI should be a system where LLMs serve as core
processors. In addition to raw data, the memory in this system would store a
large number of important conclusions derived from reasoning processes.
Compared with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that merely processing raw
data, this approach not only connects semantically related information closer,
but also simplifies complex inferences at the time of querying. As an
intermediate stage, the memory will likely be in the form of natural language
descriptions, which can be directly consumed by users too. Ultimately, every
agent/person should have its own large personal model, a deep neural network
model (thus \emph{AI-native}) that parameterizes and compresses all types of
memory, even the ones cannot be described by natural languages. Finally, we

time-consuming task, even for skilled commentators. Large language models
(LLMs) have simplified the process of natural language generation, but their
direct application in commentary creation still faces challenges due to unique
task requirements. These requirements can be categorized into two levels: 1)
fundamental requirements, which include creating well-structured and logically
consistent narratives, and 2) advanced requirements, which involve generating
quality arguments and providing convincing evidence. In this paper, we
introduce Xinyu, an efficient LLM-based system designed to assist commentators
in generating Chinese commentaries. To meet the fundamental requirements, we
deconstruct the generation process into sequential steps, proposing targeted
strategies and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for each step. To address the
advanced requirements, we present an argument ranking model for arguments and
establish a comprehensive evidence database that includes up-to-date events and
classic books, thereby strengthening the substantiation of the evidence with
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology. To evaluate the generated
commentaries more fairly, corresponding to the two-level requirements, we
introduce a comprehensive evaluation metric that considers five distinct
perspectives in commentary generation. Our experiments confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed system. We also observe a significant increase in
the efficiency of commentators in real-world scenarios, with the average time
spent on creating a commentary dropping from 4 hours to 20 minutes.
Importantly, such an increase in efficiency does not compromise the quality of
the commentaries.",Yiquan Wu

  Technology for Personalized Step 1 Prep)","Traditional medical basic sciences educational approaches follow a
one-size-fits-all model, neglecting the diverse learning styles of individual
students. I propose an intelligent AI companion which will fill this gap by
providing on-the-fly solutions to students' questions in the context of not
only USMLE Step 1 but also other similar examinations in other countries, inter
alia, PLAB Part 1 in United Kingdom, and NEET (PG) and FMGE in India. I have
harnessed Generative AI for dynamic, accurate, human-like responses and for
knowledge retention and application. Users were encouraged to employ prompt
engineering, in particular, in-context learning, for response optimization and
enhancing the model's precision in understanding the intent of the user through
the way the query is framed. The implementation of RAG has enhanced the
chatbot's ability to combine pre-existing medical knowledge with generative
capabilities for efficient and contextually relevant support. Mistral was
employed using Python to perform the needed functions. The digital
conversational agent was implemented and achieved a score of 0.5985 on a
reference-based metric similar to BLEU and ROUGE scores. My approach addresses
a critical gap in traditional medical basic sciences education by introducing
an intelligent AI companion which specializes in helping medical aspirants with
planning and information retention for USMLE Step 1 and other similar exams.
Considering the stress that medical aspirants face in studying for the exam and
in obtaining spontaneous answers to medical basic sciences queries, especially
whose answers are challenging to obtain by searching online, and obviating a
student's need to search bulky medical texts or lengthy indices or appendices,
I have been able to create a quality assistant capable of producing ad-libitum

Language Model (LLM) development. This paper introduces an easy-to-use,
extensible, and scale-flexible open-source data preparation toolkit called Data
Prep Kit (DPK). DPK is architected and designed to enable users to scale their
data preparation to their needs. With DPK they can prepare data on a local
machine or effortlessly scale to run on a cluster with thousands of CPU Cores.
DPK comes with a highly scalable, yet extensible set of modules that transform
natural language and code data. If the user needs additional transforms, they
can be easily developed using extensive DPK support for transform creation.
These modules can be used independently or pipelined to perform a series of
operations. In this paper, we describe DPK architecture and show its
performance from a small scale to a very large number of CPUs. The modules from
DPK have been used for the preparation of Granite Models [1] [2]. We believe
DPK is a valuable contribution to the AI community to easily prepare data to
enhance the performance of their LLM models or to fine-tune models with

  Thoroughly","There have been many benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models
(LCLMs), but developers often rely on synthetic tasks like needle-in-a-haystack
(NIAH) or arbitrary subsets of tasks. It remains unclear whether they translate
to the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and the inconsistency further
complicates model comparison. We investigate the underlying reasons behind
current practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals
due to low coverage of applications, insufficient lengths, unreliable metrics,
and incompatibility with base models. In this work, we present HELMET (How to
Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive
benchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories. We also
address many issues in previous benchmarks by adding controllable lengths up to
128k tokens, model-based evaluation for reliable metrics, and few-shot
prompting for robustly evaluating base models. Consequently, we demonstrate
that HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs.
Through a comprehensive study of 51 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks
like NIAH are not good predictors of downstream performance; (2) the diverse
categories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlation with each
other; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models
significantly lag behind closed ones when the task requires full-context
reasoning or following complex instructions -- the gap widens with increased
lengths. Finally, we recommend using our RAG tasks for fast model development,
as they are easy to run and more predictive of other downstream performance;
ultimately, we advocate for a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks.",Howard Yen

well-explored. These bugs are often concealed in the input validation and
error-checking code of DL libraries and can lead to silent failures, incorrect
results, or unexpected program behavior in DL applications. Despite their
potential to significantly impact the reliability and performance of DL-enabled
systems built with these libraries, checker bugs have received limited
attention.
  We present the first comprehensive study of DL checker bugs in two
widely-used DL libraries, i.e., TensorFlow and PyTorch. Initially, we
automatically collected a dataset of 2,418 commits from TensorFlow and PyTorch
repositories on GitHub from Sept. 2016 to Dec. 2023 using specific keywords
related to checker bugs. Through manual inspection, we identified 527 DL
checker bugs. Subsequently, we analyzed these bugs from three perspectives,
i.e., root causes, symptoms, and fixing patterns. Using the knowledge gained
via root cause analysis of checker bugs, we further propose TensorGuard, a
proof-of-concept RAG-based LLM-based tool to detect and fix checker bugs in DL
libraries via prompt engineering a series of ChatGPT prompts. We evaluated
TensorGuard's performance on a test dataset that includes 92 buggy and 135
clean checker-related changes in TensorFlow and PyTorch from January 2024 to
July 2024. Our results demonstrate that TensorGuard has high average recall
(94.51\%) using Chain of Thought prompting, a balanced performance between
precision and recall using Zero-Shot prompting and Few-Shot prompting
strategies. In terms of patch generation, TensorGuard achieves an accuracy of
11.1\%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art bug repair baseline by 2\%. We
have also applied TensorGuard on the latest six months' checker-related changes

  Carlo Simulations in FLUKA","Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly using FLUKA, are essential for
replicating real-world scenarios across scientific and engineering fields.
Despite the robustness and versatility, FLUKA faces significant limitations in
automation and integration with external post-processing tools, leading to
workflows with a steep learning curve, which are time-consuming and prone to
human errors. Traditional methods involving the use of shell and Python
scripts, MATLAB, and Microsoft Excel require extensive manual intervention and
lack flexibility, adding complexity to evolving scenarios. This study explores
the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents to address these
limitations. AI agents, integrate natural language processing with autonomous
reasoning for decision-making and adaptive planning, making them ideal for
automation. We introduce AutoFLUKA, an AI agent application developed using the
LangChain Python Framework to automate typical MC simulation workflows in
FLUKA. AutoFLUKA can modify FLUKA input files, execute simulations, and
efficiently process results for visualization, significantly reducing human
labor and error. Our case studies demonstrate that AutoFLUKA can handle both
generalized and domain-specific cases, such as Microdosimetry, with an
streamlined automated workflow, showcasing its scalability and flexibility. The
study also highlights the potential of Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG)
tools to act as virtual assistants for FLUKA, further improving user
experience, time and efficiency. In conclusion, AutoFLUKA represents a
significant advancement in automating MC simulation workflows, offering a
robust solution to the inherent limitations. This innovation not only saves

  Commercial DRAM-PIMs","Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), which enables efficient semantic
similarity search in large datasets, has become a fundamental component of
critical applications such as information retrieval and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). However, ANNS is a well-known I/O-intensive algorithm with a
low compute-to-I/O ratio, often requiring massive storage due to the large
volume of high-dimensional data. This leads to I/O bottlenecks on CPUs and
memory limitations on GPUs. DRAM-based Processing-in-Memory (DRAM-PIM)
architecture, which offers high bandwidth, large-capacity memory, and the
ability to perform efficient computation in or near the data, presents a
promising solution for ANNS. In this work, we investigate the use of commercial
DRAM-PIM for ANNS for the first time and propose DRIM-ANN, an optimized ANNS
engine based on DRAM-PIMs from UPMEM. Notably, given that the target DRAM-PIM
exhibits an even lower compute-to-I/O ratio than basic ANNS, we leverage lookup
tables (LUTs) to replace more multiplications with I/O operations. We then
systematically tune ANNS to search optimized configurations with lower
computational load, aligning the compute-to-I/O ratio of ANNS with that of
DRAM-PIMs while maintaining accuracy constraints. Building on this tuned ANNS
algorithm, we further explore implementation optimizations to fully utilize the
two thousand parallel processing units with private local memory in DRAM-PIMs.
To address the load imbalance caused by ANNS requests distributed across
different clusters of large datasets, we propose a load-balancing strategy that
combines static data layout optimization with dynamic runtime request
scheduling. Experimental results on representative datasets show that DRIM-ANN
achieves an average performance speedup of 2.92x compared to a 32-thread CPU

limitation poses a challenge for astronauts who must rely on in-situ tools to
access the large volume of data from spacecraft sensors, rovers, and
satellites, data that is often fragmented and difficult to use. To bridge this
gap, systems like the Mars Exploration Telemetry-Driven Information System

reducing the reliance on mission control. Current Generative Pretrained
Transformer (GPT) Models, while powerful, struggle in safety-critical

GPTs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and
Augmented Reality (AR). The idea is to allow astronauts to interact with their

follows a three-step process: (1) diverse candidate code generation; (2)
self-evaluation of codes and (3) confidence scoring and uncertainty estimation
enabling human deferral to ensure reliability. We evaluate ALIGN on harmonizing
medication terms into Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) and medical history
terms into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes
extracted from 22 immunology trials. ALIGN outperformed the LLM baselines,
while also providing capabilities for trustworthy deployment. For MedDRA
coding, ALIGN achieved high accuracy across all levels, matching RAG and
excelling at the most specific levels (87-90% for HLGT). For ATC coding, ALIGN
demonstrated superior performance, particularly at lower hierarchy levels (ATC
Level 4), with 72-73% overall accuracy and 86-89% accuracy for common

comprehensive knowledge embedded in LLMs. We first formulate a design strategy
(e.g., circuit architecture using a number of circuit components) based on

assembled into a complete topology, and transistor sizing is obtained through
Bayesian optimization. Simulation results of the netlist are fed back to the
LLM for further topology refinement, ensuring the circuit design specifications

delayed intervention leading to an irreversible disability of the patient.
Since diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) using the magnetic resonance image (MRI)

DWI has been a research topic of clinical importance. While text radiology
reports contain the most relevant clinical information from the image findings,
the difficulty of mapping across different modalities has limited the
factuality of conventional direct DWI-to-report generation methods. Here, we
propose paired image-domain retrieval and text-domain augmentation (PIRTA), a
cross-modal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for providing
clinician-interpretative AIS radiology reports with improved factuality. PIRTA
mitigates the need for learning cross-modal mapping, which poses difficulty in
image-to-text generation, by casting the cross-modal mapping problem as an
in-domain retrieval of similar DWI images that have paired ground-truth text
radiology reports. By exploiting the retrieved radiology reports to augment the
report generation process of the query image, we show by experiments with
extensive in-house and public datasets that PIRTA can accurately retrieve
