  Extraction","This paper addresses a crucial challenge in retrieval-augmented
generation-based relation extractors; the end-to-end training is not applicable
to conventional retrieval-augmented generation due to the non-differentiable
nature of instance retrieval. This problem prevents the instance retrievers
from being optimized for the relation extraction task, and conventionally it
must be trained with an objective different from that for relation extraction.
To address this issue, we propose a novel End-to-end Trainable
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ETRAG), which allows end-to-end optimization of
the entire model, including the retriever, for the relation extraction
objective by utilizing a differentiable selection of the $k$ nearest instances.
We evaluate the relation extraction performance of ETRAG on the TACRED dataset,
which is a standard benchmark for relation extraction. ETRAG demonstrates
consistent improvements against the baseline model as retrieved instances are
added. Furthermore, the analysis of instances retrieved by the end-to-end
trained retriever confirms that the retrieved instances contain common relation
labels or entities with the query and are specialized for the target task. Our
findings provide a promising foundation for future research on
retrieval-augmented generation and the broader applications of text generation
in Natural Language Processing.",Kohei Makino

this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to
refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting
to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding

the hallucination of large language models (LLMs). However, existing research
lacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation on
different large language models, which make it challenging to identify the
potential bottlenecks in the capabilities of RAG for different LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented
Generation on large language models. We analyze the performance of different
large language models in 4 fundamental abilities required for RAG, including
noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and
counterfactual robustness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented
Generation Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in both English and
Chinese. RGB divides the instances within the benchmark into 4 separate
testbeds based on the aforementioned fundamental abilities required to resolve
the case. Then we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diagnose the
challenges of current LLMs when applying RAG. Evaluation reveals that while
LLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robustness, they still struggle
significantly in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and
dealing with false information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes indicate
that there is still a considerable journey ahead to effectively apply RAG to

achievements in various domains. However, the untimeliness and cost of
knowledge updates coupled with hallucination issues of LLMs have curtailed
their applications in knowledge intensive tasks, where retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) can be of help. Nevertheless, existing retrieval augmented
models typically use similarity as a bridge between queries and documents and
follow a retrieve then read procedure. In this work, we argue that similarity
is not always the panacea and totally relying on similarity would sometimes
degrade the performance of retrieval augmented generation. To this end, we
propose MetRag, a Multi layEred Thoughts enhanced Retrieval Augmented
Generation framework. To begin with, beyond existing similarity oriented
thought, we embrace a small scale utility model that draws supervision from an
LLM for utility oriented thought and further come up with a smarter model by
comprehensively combining the similarity and utility oriented thoughts.
Furthermore, given the fact that the retrieved document set tends to be huge
and using them in isolation makes it difficult to capture the commonalities and
characteristics among them, we propose to make an LLM as a task adaptive
summarizer to endow retrieval augmented generation with compactness-oriented

is called for knowledge augmented generation. Extensive experiments on

such as document-based question answering (DBQA). However, the effectiveness of
RAG is highly dependent on its configuration. To systematically find the
optimal configuration, we introduce RAGGED, a framework for analyzing RAG
configurations across various DBQA tasks. Using the framework, we discover
distinct LM behaviors in response to varying context quantities, context
qualities, and retrievers. For instance, while some models are robust to noisy
contexts, monotonically performing better with more contexts, others are more
noise-sensitive and can effectively use only a few contexts before declining in
performance. This framework also provides a deeper analysis of these
differences by evaluating the LMs' sensitivity to signal and noise under
specific context quality conditions. Using RAGGED, researchers and
practitioners can derive actionable insights about how to optimally configure
their RAG systems for their specific question-answering tasks.",Jennifer Hsia

  Questions","Generative search engines have the potential to transform how people seek

Nonetheless, retrieval-augmented generation exacerbates safety concerns, since
adversaries may successfully evade the entire system by subtly manipulating the
most vulnerable part of a claim. To this end, we propose evaluating the
robustness of generative search engines in the realistic and high-risk setting,
where adversaries have only black-box system access and seek to deceive the
model into returning incorrect responses. Through a comprehensive human
evaluation of various generative search engines, such as Bing Chat,
PerplexityAI, and YouChat across diverse queries, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of adversarial factual questions in inducing incorrect responses.
Moreover, retrieval-augmented generation exhibits a higher susceptibility to
factual errors compared to LLMs without retrieval. These findings highlight the
potential security risks of these systems and emphasize the need for rigorous
evaluation before deployment.",Xuming Hu

for a weak assessment of model similarity. Thus, in this study, we evaluate the
similarity of embedding models within the context of RAG systems. Our
assessment is two-fold: We use Centered Kernel Alignment to compare embeddings
on a pair-wise level. Additionally, as it is especially pertinent to RAG

using Jaccard and rank similarity. We compare different families of embedding
models, including proprietary ones, across five datasets from the popular

clusters of models corresponding to model families, but interestingly, also
some inter-family clusters. Furthermore, our analysis of top-k retrieval

  Augmented Generation","The existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges in terms of cost and effectiveness. On one hand, they need to encode
the lengthy retrieved contexts before responding to the input tasks, which
imposes substantial computational overhead. On the other hand, directly using
generic Large Language Models (LLMs) often leads to sub-optimal answers, while
task-specific fine-tuning may compromise the LLMs' general capabilities. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called FlexRAG
(Flexible Context Adaptation for RAG). In this approach, the retrieved contexts
are compressed into compact embeddings before being encoded by the LLMs.
Simultaneously, these compressed embeddings are optimized to enhance downstream
RAG performance. A key feature of FlexRAG is its flexibility, which enables
effective support for diverse compression ratios and selective preservation of
important contexts. Thanks to these technical designs, FlexRAG achieves
superior generation quality while significantly reducing running costs.
Comprehensive experiments on various question-answering datasets validate our
approach as a cost-effective and flexible solution for RAG systems.",Zheng Liu

  Language Models to Specialized Domains","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the question-answering (QA)
abilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge.
However, adapting general-purpose RAG systems to specialized fields such as
science and medicine poses unique challenges due to distribution shifts and
limited access to domain-specific data. To tackle this, we propose SimRAG, a
self-training approach that equips the LLM with joint capabilities of question
answering and question generation for domain adaptation. Our method first
fine-tunes the LLM on instruction-following, question-answering, and
search-related data. Then, it prompts the same LLM to generate diverse
domain-relevant questions from unlabeled corpora, with an additional filtering
strategy to retain high-quality synthetic examples. By leveraging these
synthetic examples, the LLM can improve their performance on domain-specific
RAG tasks. Experiments on 11 datasets, spanning two backbone sizes and three
domains, demonstrate that SimRAG outperforms baselines by 1.2\%--8.6\%.",Ran Xu

  K-12 Educational Question Answering with Knowledge Discrepancies","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have demonstrated remarkable
potential as question answering systems in the K-12 Education domain, where
knowledge is typically queried within the restricted scope of authoritative
textbooks. However, the discrepancy between textbooks and the parametric
knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) could undermine the effectiveness of
RAG systems. To systematically investigate the robustness of RAG systems under
such knowledge discrepancies, we present EduKDQA, a question answering dataset
that simulates knowledge discrepancies in real applications by applying
hypothetical knowledge updates in answers and source documents. EduKDQA
includes 3,005 questions covering five subjects, under a comprehensive question
typology from the perspective of context utilization and knowledge integration.
We conducted extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering
performance. We find that most RAG systems suffer from a substantial
performance drop in question answering with knowledge discrepancies, while
questions that require integration of contextual knowledge and parametric

attend to all contexts. Previous work has addressed this by synthesizing
contexts with perturbed positions of gold segment, creating a
position-diversified train set. We extend this intuition to propose consistency
regularization with augmentation and distillation. First, we augment each
training instance with its position perturbation to encourage consistent
predictions, regardless of ordering. We also distill behaviors of this pair,
although it can be counterproductive in certain RAG scenarios where the given
order from the retriever is crucial for generation quality. We thus propose
CORD, balancing COnsistency and Rank Distillation. CORD adaptively samples
noise-controlled perturbations from an interpolation space, ensuring both

DePaC (Dehallucinating Parallel Context Extension), which alleviates the

NoMIRACL, a human-annotated dataset for evaluating LLM robustness in RAG across
