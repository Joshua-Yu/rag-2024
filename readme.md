## 2024 - Year of RAG

2024 has made a start of an unprecedented surge in research on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A quick search on arXiv reveals a staggering 1,202 papers published in 2024 alone, dwarfing the 93 that appeared in 2023 and the mere 10 in 2022. This explosive growth signals a major shift in the AI communityâ€™s priorities and marks 2024 as a breakthrough year for RAG. However, what does this mean to enterprises, and has RAG actually delivered its promises?
